p1,im pretty good ok  uhm  so have you looked at my resume or should i  alright  so i guess ah  i am course 67 here at mit  ah which is computational biology  so its a mix of computers  science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology  uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school  include camp kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer  as well as ah amphibious achievement  which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in boston   so ah  my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care  i imagined i was going be a doctor growing up  and then it came down to the tee and im like  well i can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people ok  uhm  one of the things we have to do for camp kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah  to  run the camp which is over 50 00000  ah so one of the things that i individually spearhead every year is called the camp kesem i say you did auction  where actually my fraternity and i go out and solicit uhm  donations in the form of gift cards  ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates  and then we use this money obviously we donate it to camp kesem i spearhead the entire event and i kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups  and i send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan    ahh  i guess the easiest team project i just i just had  was  last semester  uhm i worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture and we were put in a group of 3 people  and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally  but it ended up being by the end of it  that someone didnt like put there fair share of work inah essentially we talked to him we didnt really get it out  we actually had to go to some of the tas we got a little bit ah  and that kinda like pushed him forward  so i mean i guess what i am showing is like  im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself    uhmmm  i would say for this job  ah im a little technically underprepared  ah ive yet  i have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes  but i think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles  ah  im very interested  in the subject of computation biology  and i think that i will be able to contribute a lot to this field  uhm ive had a good amount of experience and i think i will be a solid intern ,4.89158004615,1,im pretty good ok look resume alright guess ah course mit ah computational biology mix computer science biology actually thats interest lie apply like algorithmic kinda software engineering datasets deal genomics biology activity side school include camp kesem summer camp run completely free kid whose parent cancer well ah amphibious achievement ah high school tutor program inner city kid boston ah interest kinda lay little bit health care imagine go doctor grow come tee im like well engineering still apply thing help lot people ok one thing camp kesem orgin fundraise money ah run camp ah one thing individually spearhead every year call camp kesem say auction actually fraternity go solicit donation form gift card ah raise money date auction actually sell date use money obviously donate camp kesem spearhead entire event kinda orginize everyone committee group send people make sure everything go accord plan ahh guess easy team project last semester work six double five project algorithm software architecture put group people standard know sign contract everyone suppose work equally end end someone didnt like put fair share work inah essentially talked didnt really get actually go tas get little bit ah kinda like push forward mean guess show like im affraid go right method like authority like case situation present uhmmm would say job ah im little technically underprepared ah ive yet take introductory software class far well introductory bio class think sheer interest sheer effort able kinda overcome obstacle ah im interested subject computation biology think able contribute lot field ive good amount experience think solid intern
p10,great  how about you im a little  by the resurgence of the hurricane  but yeah  we were half way here and it just turned on a switch  lightening  winds and everything so yeah okay  um  im a junior here at mit  um  im studying aerospace engineering  um  my  my interests are generally in food mechanics  control  um  design  um  mostly aircraft  but protozoan  problems in general um  i like to  um  i like to play music  listen to music  um  i run  do some other team sports  i like to play hockey  um  okay  so  uh  one of the projects that ive worked on since coming to mit  um  was during my freshman year  i worked in the  in the uh  artificial intelligence group in  uh  cesil sp  which is a lab  a computer science lab here at mit and  um  i was working on a project with another student  actually another freshman  uh  basically we were tasked with the  sort of  bringing this project  starting this project  bring it up to the level where it could be presented at conference  um  together  and we were kind of left  to work out the cooperation on our own and um   there was  um  as the conference got closer  about halfway  um  about halfway through the year freshman year  ah  there were a bunch of issues that we had with um  with um  basically meeting the expectations that had been set before us in terms of what we were going to present um  and finishing in a timely basis and it came down to whether we were really going to be able to  and there were other basically  parts  other peoples work in the same group where work depended on us finishing in time  so it really  um  really  we had to make a decision weather we were just going to basically get done what we could  but to the quality standard that  the standard of quality that was expected of us  or to um  try to finish everything and to have other peoples work potentially suffer because of our  hadnt really been up to snuff and  um  and so  we kind of had a little bit of a disagreement about this  but what ended up happening was  um  i went and talked to the professor and um  sort of decided to um  make them aware of what was happening  because they werent really aware that we had fallen behind and  um  sort of got the other student on board  who had disagreed with me  uh to do this  uh  and to let everyone else know what was going on  and uh  we ended up presenting a lot less than what was originally expected  but  um  i think it was very much for the better  okay  um  so  another  another thing that i spend a lot of my time doing is called  is an organization called design  build  fly here  um  its  its a design competition um  run by the iaa  which is an aerospace professional organization  and um   and uh  you can enter a team from any university or group  basically anywhere in the world its mostly us university though and  um  these university teams basically build a plane  um  design it  build it  fly it as the competition name suggests and you compete them all at the end of the year  compete against the other universities at the end of the year at one competition basically  um  last year we had  uh  a design challenge  it was pretty unique  um  and um  so  ill take that as our challenge  um  so we basically had a year to solve this  um  and i was head of one of the subgroups last year  the actual design subgroup  and um  i mean  we approached in a methodical way  just like i think thats the best way to solve most problems  um  got input from every team member  um  and um  basically  um  looked at  looked at all our possibilities  um   and um we ran the numbers  ultimately  like i think thats the best way to solve most problems we ended up with um  a design that got the best overall score on the basis of just  basically incorporating  um  every team members input okay  um  so one of my  i think definitely since coming here  ive noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication um  i really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school  but i um  definitely since coming here  i find that perhaps um at the expense of technical skills  my written communication skills have atrophied  maybe is the right word and  um  so i definitely  i think im um  pretty aware of this and um  and um i would definitely like to improve it and um so what im going to do is try to force myself whenever im writing papers or taking reports for  whether it be for research or for classes  just to go through the proper revision cycle  force myself to make sure that im actually being  um  that im being succinct in what im saying  have other people reading give me feedback okay  um  i  um  i mean  i think  i dont know what this position that it is yeah  sure  but if i knew that this position was  i think that i would want it because um  this is really what i thrive off of i  um  enjoy doing it  um  and i would be excited to come to work every day to do it um  which  um  thats like the biggest thing for me i um  i would be excited to come do it and i know i would put my  you know  put my all into doing a good job at it  because i would be excited to come do it and  um  i think that um  i have a decent skill set to do this and i think that im qualified to contribute in this area ,3.57596013125,0,great im little resurgence hurricane yeah half way turn switch lighten wind everything yeah okay um im junior mit um im study aerospace engineering um interest generally food mechanic control um design um mostly aircraft protozoan problem general um like um like play music listen music um run team sport like play hockey um okay uh one project ive work since come mit um freshman year work uh artificial intelligence group uh cesil sp lab computer science lab mit um work project another student actually another freshman uh basically task sort bring project start project bring level could present conference um together kind leave work cooperation um um conference get close halfway um halfway year freshman year ah bunch issue um um basically meet expectation set u term go present um finish timely basis come whether really go able basically part people work group work depend u finish time really um really make decision weather go basically get do could quality standard standard quality expect u um try finish everything people work potentially suffer hadnt really snuff um kind little bit disagreement end happen um go talked professor um sort decide um make aware happen werent really aware fall behind um sort get student board disagree uh uh let everyone else know go uh end present lot less originally expect um think much good okay um another another thing spend lot time call organization call design build fly um design competition um run iaa aerospace professional organization um uh enter team university group basically anywhere world mostly u university though um university team basically build plane um design build fly competition name suggest compete end year compete university end year one competition basically um last year uh design challenge pretty unique um um ill take challenge um basically year solve um head one subgroup last year actual design subgroup um mean approach methodical way like think thats best way solve problem um get input every team member um um basically um look looked possibility um um ran number ultimately like think thats best way solve problem end um design get best overall score basis basically incorporate um every team member input okay um one think definitely since come ive notice one big weakness write communication um really intimidate think high school um definitely since come find perhaps um expense technical skill write communication skill atrophy maybe right word um definitely think im um pretty aware um um would definitely like improve um im go try force whenever im write paper take report whether research class go proper revision cycle force make sure im actually um im succinct im say people read give feedback okay um um mean think dont know position yeah sure know position think would want um really thrive um enjoy um would excite come work every day um um thats like big thing um would excite come know would put know put good job would excite come um think um decent skill set think im qualify contribute area
p11,uhh  im a junior at mit  uhh im double majoring in management and biology  er  im very interested in the world of finance  uh  business  consulting all of those sorts of things um  so ive tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh  those sort of roles in the business world outside of school  i enjoy running  crosscountry and track  im on the varsity team at mit and umm  im also very involved in greek life at mit  so im on the panhellenic executive board as vice president of programming  and also hold a leadership position in my sorority  umm  so i think this past year  my biggest priority has been my position as vice president of programming for panhellenic and umm  just in that position  uhh  i hold a leadership role on the exec board we have weekly meetings  im charge of putting together our programming calendar for our entire year so i have interface with a lot of mit faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities uhh  to meet and attend different events and i think to put together all these events im working together with different people on campus i have to show leadership and show strong communication skills  umm  so i guess this past semester actually  im associate advisor for umm  freshmen and i work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor  and er   the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and i think we all  er  were very uhh  set on our ideas so having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together  um  so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first  cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from but after that  and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be  we eventually figured out what we wanted to do  uhh  yeah so  we had  we were trying to communicate via email at first  so i think that was  uhh inefficient  especially since we had only met in a group once before  umm so meeting in person and really  trying to outline not just like   what the event was going to be  what our purpose of the event was going to be  and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen i think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event  we were able to build it up from there  umm  so i think one of my weaknesses is public speaking  actually  and uhh  i think by taking a variety of classes  especially this one class that im in  that focuses on management and communication  ive been kind of thrown into positions where i have to give impromptu speeches  uhh  and debate my point in different arguments and i think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what im saying  which i think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general i think ive been able to build up my confidence and know like  how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better  uhh  i think my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience  umm would allow me to perform well on the job i think  ive worked umm  both individually in a project as well as in a teamfocused environment  which umm  i think is key for consulting and investment banking positions i also feel that my mit background  uh  the quantitative analysis that ive done in classes  as well as my internship experiences would help perform well on the job as well  so ,4.81446592015,1,im junior mit im double major management biology er im interested world finance uh business consult sort thing um ive tried take different leadership role would prepare uh sort role business world outside school enjoy run crosscountry track im varsity team mit im also involve greek life mit im panhellenic executive board vice president program also hold leadership position sorority think past year big priority position vice president program panhellenic position hold leadership role exec board weekly meeting im charge put together program calendar entire year interface lot mit faculty bring together exec board whole different sorority meet attend different event think put together event im work together different people campus show leadership show strong communication skill guess past semester actually im associate advisor freshman work freshman advisor well another associate advisor er three u try come event host freshman think er set idea full time communicate work idea could bring thought goal together um work together formulate sort event would satisfy different goal difficult first cause meet difficult understand people come communicate main goal event would eventually figure want yeah try communicate via email first think inefficient especially since meet group meet person really try outline like event go purpose event go try communicate freshman think boil purpose event able build think one weaknesses public speak actually think take variety class especially one class im focus management communication ive kind thrown position give impromptu speech debate point different argument think practice help lot allow become comfortable confident im say think help long run like public speak general think ive able build confidence know like structure speech interview impromptus well think different leadership position well academic experience would allow perform well job think ive work individually project well teamfocused environment think key consult investment banking position also feel mit background uh quantitative analysis ive do class well internship experience would help perform well job well
p12,im good  how are you ok  so  im a junior at mit majoring in mechanical engineering uh my focus is in uh robotics and product design uh im originally from seattle  washington ummm im really interested in a combination of robotics and like psychology  phased in so artificial intelligence  or that vein of thinking um im also  i do a little bit of theater on the side so  considering doing some sort of combination its a wide range of interests so im trying to figure out a way to uh put in a lot of it into one thing but  yeah mmhmm yeah  ok so  um  in high school i was a life guard and thats  it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a  a team situation um  and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi  like we taught swim lessons and i would have a partner with me and wed both be teaching the same kids and  id have to  you know  tell them what to do  or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class that sort of stuff ok ummm  not going to use the lifeguard example again uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot  ummm i dont know in history class or that kind of a thing  work  working with projects and sometimes wed have kids who wouldnt do their home do  you know their part on time  or people who didnt like they  what they were doing there was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didnt really want to do you know any of the  any of the project  she wasnt really showing up to class  wasnt doing any of the  any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her  and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way in what way like  yeah so i mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening and then  the next  the next day when the girl came to class we  you know sat her down  asked her why she wasnt doing the homework whatever  that kind of stuff but it was  it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything so laughs ok ummm  i have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once  and i sometimes put too much on my plate and i recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when theyve given you too much to do so i think its kind of  in terms of how im trying to improve that  is be realistic with myself on the amount of time i have or what my skills are and if i need help ask for it or if i need someone to do part of it  ask for it and early on  not the day before something has to be done  tell them that its not going to happen ummmm i think you should hire me because your company  ummm is a great  would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an engineer umm and i think i could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like  like my wide interests  and  and education background ,4.3189479661,0,im good ok im junior mit major mechanical engineering uh focus uh robotics product design uh im originally seattle washington ummm im really interested combination robotics like psychology phase artificial intelligence vein think um im also little bit theater side consider sort combination wide range interest im try figure way uh put lot one thing yeah mmhmm yeah ok um high school life guard thats great job lot work lifeguard kind team situation um lot time one person would step order leader know uh like swi like taught swim lesson would partner wed teach kid id know tell tell exactly go class sort stuff ok ummm go use lifeguard example uhhhh high school would work team project lot ummm dont know history class kind thing work work project sometimes wed kid wouldnt home know part time people didnt like one specific time conflict one girl decide didnt really want know project wasnt really showing class wasnt stuff talk figure go kind resolve conflict way way like yeah mean u group meet teacher tell happen next next day girl come class know sat ask wasnt homework whatever kind stuff case high school kid want anything laugh ok ummm really bad habit try everything sometimes put much plate recognize delegate task group tell someone theyve give much think kind term im try improve realistic amount time skill need help ask need someone part ask early day something do tell go happen ummmm think hire company ummm great would great opportunity learn improve engineer think could add lot team general term like like wide interest education background
p13,good ok  umm  im currently a junior at mit studying electrical engineering and computer science umm  i first became interested in engineering in high school  i guess  when i worked in a lab at  a material science lab  at uc berkley umm  and since then ive worked at a variety of different places including labs and at  uh  and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here  and at standford  and umm promex industries  which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley umm  in high school i was part of the school orchestra and i played bassoon i was the principle bassoon there so  that means i was in charge of the bassoon section so basically  umm  i ran extra  i ran practices for  within our section outside of  uh   when the orchestra would get together and practice i coordinated that i also  uh  set up events between the woodwind sections to  uh you know  so people would get to know each other and  you know  we could practice together and things like that umm  this past summer i worked in spain umm  in operations research and i was part of a research group there umm  it was  so  we had  uh  within our team  it was  communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my spanish isnt so great and their english wasnt so great so  umm  what we ended  we basically communicated through like  the papers  through the papers we read  umm  we  well  one thing that helped was  we both got  like everyone  they got better at speaking english  i got better at understanding them i guess they got better at understanding my spanish also so  we were able to communicate by just  you know  talking really slowly  repeating everything a couple times umm  we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that those were written mostly in english  so that was  that wasnt so much of a problem for mebutit made it  because they were working in the area already and i was new to the area  looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was  what i was supposed to do umm  things like that umm  well  one thing right now is that i can get really hung up on small details and  uh  it becomes a problem because its  it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of  like  the big picture but since coming to mit ive been  ive been involved in a lot of classes  a lot of activites and things and thats forced me to manage my time better  so  now that  uh  like  i have  because i have a lot of time constraints  im forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever  and i cant  i cant get caught up in  like  little things that dont ultimately make a big a difference so  um  by being forced to manage my time more  im  uh  overcoming this problem well  i have the  i have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish  uh  accomplish project goals and get things done uh  i can solve problems and  and can work pretty well in a team im also very interested in what this company does  and  um  id really like to work there ,4.91606339181,1,good ok im currently junior mit study electrical engineering computer science first become interested engineering high school guess work lab material science lab uc berkley since ive work variety different place include labs uh industry include electrical engineering lab standford promex industry chip packaging company silicon valley high school part school orchestra play bassoon principle bassoon mean charge bassoon section basically run extra ran practice within section outside uh orchestra would get together practice coordinate also uh set event woodwind section uh know people would get know know could practice together thing like past summer work spain operation research part research group uh within team communicate big challenge spanish isnt great english wasnt great end basically communicate like paper paper read well one thing help got like everyone get well speak english get well understand guess get well understand spanish also able communicate know talk really slowly repeat everything couple time also lot technical thing mostly related technical paper thing like write mostly english wasnt much problem mebutit make work area already new area look make easier understand role suppose thing like well one thing right get really hang small detail uh becomes problem distract cause lose sight like big picture since come mit ive ive involve lot class lot activites thing thats force manage time well uh like lot time constraint im force finish project assignment whatever cant cant get catch like little thing dont ultimately make big difference um force manage time im uh overcome problem well quantitative qualitative skill necessary accomplish uh accomplish project goal get thing do uh solve problem work pretty well team im also interested company um id really like work
p14,good  how are you im a student at mit and im a junior right now but im probably gonna graduate this year  so  uh  thats kind of exciting at scary at the same time  uh  like i said im a computer science major so some of the stuff that im interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff  ive got a bunch of experience with web development mainly  uh front end development so thats uh  i guess where a lot of my experience lies   um  so i was  a member of the society of women engineers and with the graduate students association of mit and the senior class  they run the fall career fair which is the only career fair in the fall and its the biggest at mit  i was actually the publicity chair for that  so  it involves you know  interfacing  you know  with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guide book and making sure all of the information is readily available to students but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself  so  um  it definitely was a lot of responsibility and not only did i have to become a leader for the society of women engineers but also fora leader for this smaller team of seven people that ran the career fair itself    well  iso  for one of my classes  we have to  its a software design class where you have to work with other students  so  i was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasnt pulling their weight and wasnt contributing in a way that was you know  fair and even  and so what we ended up doing is  we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk  we were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her  it was not playing off her strengths  so  we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths    um  i think one of my weaknesses is im a perfectionist so when i do work on teams i have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because i want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is  but what ive done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um  like  say no to a task and just kind of  i guess  modualize sic projects more  so  i think i had trouble when i was always thinking big picture and then i would want to look at every single detail i that big picture  but if i just give myself one part of the project and just  you know  divide it into different modules in my head then im able to just  you know  perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail uh  i think that my skill set is pretty unique because im both technical and also wellspoken and id be able to communicate really well  and i think its a unique combination to have both of those skills ,5.67303503772,1,good im student mit im junior right im probably gon na graduate year uh thats kind excite scary time uh like say im computer science major stuff im interested computational photography lot graphic stuff ive get bunch experience web development mainly uh front end development thats uh guess lot experience lie um member society woman engineer graduate student association mit senior class run fall career fair career fair fall big mit actually publicity chair involve know interfacing know company deal make guide book make sure information readily available student also publicize individual info session obviously career fair um definitely lot responsibility become leader society woman engineer also fora leader small team seven people run career fair well iso one class software design class work student assign two teammate randomly one teammate really wasnt pull weight wasnt contribute way know fair even end thankfully able sit talk able get hold realize divide work way make really difficult play strength redistribute work able thing still helpful played strength um think one weaknesses im perfectionist work team trouble sometimes delegate task want micromanage make sure everything way ive do overcome basically sort familiarize um like say task kind guess modualize sic project think trouble always think big picture would want look every single detail big picture give one part project know divide different module head im able know perfect one part much focus every little detail uh think skill set pretty unique im technical also wellspoken id able communicate really well think unique combination skill
p15,im doing fine uh  thank you how about you um  have you like you know um  the storm  i hope that hasnt like disturbed any power too much  oh yeah i mean boston didnt get hit too bad so  thats at least very fortunate  um  okay so im a current junior at mit  im studying biological engineering um  so its some  some of the things i do on campus um  im really involved in um  mit met life so im  im secretary of the club and i go to the meetings um  and um  part of my roles like help you know organize groups where um  poster sessions and information sessions just like spread the word of met life on campus um  and thats um  sort of helps me like explore like it has really gotten me more interested in a field of like healthcare um  that plus like my um  my studies um  im also involved in chinese student club escort culture so i do a lot of you know pudding on campus for um  events like night market which i worked  i helped organize just last week so um  it that sort of helps me with communication  my communication skills you know talking to the officers of other student clubs  okay so um  last um  uh  this past summer i worked in a research lab in bangkok and it was the first time that i had ever been outside of you know the united states for an extended period of time  and one of my assignments was to you know sort of lead uh  sort of like drive the direction of like a research project that they were doing  which was to research um  a generic um  in hopes of releasing it to the market  um  sometime in the future because i had  i was partnered up with some a lab partner that was less experienced than i was um  i found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments  um  it was  it was a little bit of a strange dynamic because she was older than me because she was an incoming graduate student  but she did not have much research like lab experience so i had to balance like being informative without making it seem like this  like she was in some ways my superior so that was like an um  i had  i had to like teach her the techniques you know coming off as like oh i know more than you do  um  but what i found was what worked for both of us was that um i would like explain it to her before we were in the lab which helped cut down a lot of the frustration that came up if like she had to ask me questions like every  like between like every set so thats um  thats probably the one way i showed leadership  okay so the  a couple um  ips i worked for a start up um  they were a green billing research directory  online and i worked for my fellow exterior on helping to market this  the use of this directory to the clients um  so we had to  it was a little bit difficult because we had to like  we had to cold call like people and getting over the initial awkwardness of what its like to talk to somebody youve never met or seen before and trying to like pitch an idea to them  and be like oh theres this really great resource and youve signed up for it but weve noticed that you like hadnt used it  um  are there things that like you feel would make it better um  things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective  and um  we both had to sort of like teach ourselves how to talk to like the  the reps that were calling and we would um  strategize what worked  what didnt  what had people respond and what didnt  and and by like documenting it all down also so that we could leave like a record of what worked for maybe someone else was to found so um  eventually we actually got like a system like a way we would structure the questions and ask them that word and like list like a couple response  okay um  so something so a weakness that i found um  and im still like working to try to like overcome it is i tend to be long winded in explaining things um  its hard for me to take something that im thinking about and communicating it um  concisely um  the first time around  because i feel like i always leave something out after i finish saying it so i tend to go back and elaborate  and then while im thinking about it still ill like talk more about whats coming to mind  um  its something that ive been working on by siding it for things like this  and by trying to take up a more prominent role in like the  in like the clubs im in and like trying to you know participate more actively in the classes um  trying to as much as i can to go to um  lab presentations for my year off and speaking in front of audiences to try to um  make myself less long winded and more precise  um  i think that i can bring i dont know like something  different a new perspective to the table especially coming from mit um  having had like a very quantitative background  um  and given that ive had like extensive experience um  in research um  and my leadership activities on campus  i think that i can bring both the technical skills and um  a way to effectively  hopefully communicate to um  communicate my ideas and bring like a different sort of perspective to your company and im hardworking um  and i always wanna make sure i will do a good job and detail oriented  and um  i just love working with other people on like projects that excite me so um  thats something that i come from inaudible that flatters me is working with people elaborating and thats um  definitely a skill that i can bring to your company so thank you for your time  ,3.90089704833,0,im fine uh thank um like know um storm hope hasnt like disturbed power much oh yeah mean boston didnt get hit bad thats least fortunate um okay im current junior mit im study biological engineering um thing campus um im really involved um mit meet life im im secretary club go meeting um um part role like help know organize group um poster session information session like spread word meet life campus um thats um sort help like explore like

p16,very good  how are you yea  um so i am junior here at mit ummm studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments i am really trying to focus on international development ummm and because i am interested in either after school going in to either like public health or umm public policy type areas but both focusing on international development ummm yea  thats a little bit im from right outside of philadelphia  ummm and i am the uh  second youngest of 3   uh sure  ummm so currently i am actually the co president of an organization here on campus called club med sp and we actually started last year  but last year it was founded by a different person  ummm although i was part of the like founding board  i guess you would say ummm and i guess last year  basically what happened was the person who founded it did it for her resume and she wasnt really invested in it umm and so basically last year was pretty much a flop  we did  we didnt accomplish much last year so this year has been trying to start over ummm as well as trying to take what kind of we felt what was wrong last year and really try to fix those pieces  yea umm that is a good question  umm i think  so freshman year ummm i participated in a program here called terescope sp and its a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve ummm kind of like a world problem and so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it umm and our problem was solving world hunger so it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved  ummm  hmmm  so lets think  so that is a good question i think sometimes i have trouble working on a project when like  for example when i have too much time right so umm for example this summer i was working in dc ummm and i felt like when i wasnt given an exact dead line i didnt necessarily like push myself to work to get it done  because it wasnt  i didnt  have a dead line like i wasnt sure when i needed it to get done so i was like oh  that fine  okay i can do it later so i think one of my weaknesses i think it is pushing things off unless there is a deadline so i really have been trying setting internal deadlines for myself and trying to stick to those deadlines  and i think it is really hard  i think it is really hard when you have a lot of things to do to figure out how to prioritize and actually come through with the deadlines and i think that is really important skill throughout life so for example this week i have a lot of things due at the end of the week so trying to get at least a certain amount done by tuesday  and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something i have been trying to work on more  well  we will pretend this is the inaudible institute i am really interested in studying the intersection on nutrition and health  ummm especially in the kind of evaluating project area so recently i actually switched to economics  umm i was originally studying biology  but i felt that i could  that there is more to be done in economics in terms of helping people and i really would be excited to learn more about how food security and nutrition intersect and i would be very committed and willing to work as much as you needed me to  ,4.62732782069,0,good yea um junior mit ummm study economics well urban plan within department really try focus international development ummm interested either school go either like public health public policy type area focus international development ummm yea thats little bit im right outside philadelphia ummm uh second young uh sure ummm currently actually co president organization campus call club med sp actually start last year last year found different person ummm although part like found board guess would say ummm guess last year basically happen person found resume wasnt really invest basically last year pretty much flop didnt accomplish much last year year try start ummm well try take kind felt wrong last year really try fix piece yea good question think freshman year ummm participate program call terescope sp program basically give freshman problem solve ummm kind like world problem kind leave solve problem solve world hunger really like problem one actually solve ummm hmmm let think good question think sometimes trouble work project like example much time right example summer work dc ummm felt like wasnt give exact dead line didnt necessarily like push work get do wasnt didnt dead line like wasnt sure need get do like oh fine okay later think one weaknesses think push thing unless deadline really try set internal deadline try stick deadline think really hard think really hard lot thing figure prioritize actually come deadline think really important skill throughout life example week lot thing due end week try get least certain amount do tuesday kind like evaluate progress throughout week something try work well pretend inaudible institute really interested study intersection nutrition health ummm especially kind evaluate project area recently actually switched economics originally study biology felt could do economics term help people really would excite learn food security nutrition intersect would commit willing work much need
p17,doing well how are you um  my name is stephie um  i am a junior here at mit um  and  see  im currently studying computer science  so  um im a six three  um  and  im here hoping to  you know  get in touch  and um  see if theres any opportunity for me over at google um  see hm  so last semester  um  i took a class in software constructions so its six doubleo five here and  um  throughout the semester we had  you know  many individual projects but  also  two group projects and  um  something ive noticed very much here at mit is that people dont like to take initiative and so  um  you know my we were doing out first group project  and um  you know  my my partners were pretty cool but no one seemed to want to arrange a time to meet up and actually get work done so i jumped in  and you know  shot shot out a few emails and made it work laugh how about that um  lets talk about that second group project in this class unfortunately  my  um  my group members in this  uh  for this project were not quite as awesome as the one before um  and  uh  for some reason  um  there were two guys  and  uh  they they were overriding my code in the repository so  um  theyve completely disregarded any work ive done even after id emailed them and told them hey  you know  there are tools to help resolve conflicts in code if were both working on the same thing and so eventually  i had to go to the ta and to the professor  went spoke to ann hunter and they helped me resolve the situation so  you know  sometimes you try your best in the situation and you really some things are out of your control but  um  usually people you can go to thanks um  see i lets see  i for the longest time  even when i was small  ive always been pretty quiet  so  um  and back in elementary school even uh  on my progress reports they would they would just say stephie is is this sweet girl laughs and then  you know  id get a mediocre grade for participation  stuff like that and so thats been an on going struggle for me  um  throughout my life but  um  people really arent as scary as  as sometimes i think they they seem to be  so its been going well um  see  uh well  ive ive taken classes with  um  with like  speaking components and presentations um  so its  its a way to get in my feet into the water but  um  its been a good experience  so hmm  i think that i have a lot to offer um  my skill set is  pretty good um  you know ive ive picked up a lot of skills here at mit and also on my own  um  through research here at mit and  you know  i think  i can be a valuable asset to  to ,4.52388447566,0,well um name stephie um junior mit um see im currently study computer science um im six three um im hop know get touch um see there opportunity google um see hm last semester um take class software construction six doubleo five um throughout semester know many individual project also two group project um something ive notice much mit people dont like take initiative um know first group project um know partner pretty cool one seem want arrange time meet actually get work do jump know shot shot email make work laugh um let talk second group project class unfortunately um group member uh project quite awesome one um uh reason um two guy uh override code repository um theyve completely disregard work ive do even id email told hey know tool help resolve conflict code work thing eventually go ta professor go speak ann hunter help resolve situation know sometimes try best situation really thing control um usually people go thanks um see let see long time even small ive always pretty quiet um back elementary school even uh progress report would would say stephie sweet girl laugh know id get mediocre grade participation stuff like thats go struggle um throughout life um people really arent scary sometimes think seem go well um see uh well ive ive take class um like speak component presentation um way get foot water um good experience hmm think lot offer um skill set pretty good um know ive ive pick lot skill mit also um research mit know think valuable asset
p20,good how are you um  so im a junior at mit im majoring in environmental engineering um  and so im taking classes this semester in hydrology  environmental transport um  ive done internships previously with environmental restoration companies and i also participated in research last summer um  id like to go to grad school after i graduate in environmental enginneering again um  so this semester i became president of the womens independent living group um  after being house manager last semester so ive worked through a lot of problems within the house in trying to kind of get the right atmosphere in the house um  so as house manager  um  i organized work week at the beginning of this year so its a time when  theres about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and  um  works on the house  paints rooms  like fixes it up before the school year starts so i organized that  assigned jobs to people and facilitated that um  so im also on the rowing team and im not sure if this is exactly what youre looking for  but i guess  i was in the second boat last year and we were having a lot of problems throughout the season kind of like we would go to a race and we would be okay  but we werent performing up to our standards and so it was a big struggle for me to try and figure out how to kind of help turn the attitude around in the boat um  and we were finally able to pull it off in our very last race and we won the semifinals at patriot league so i think its the right mix of like knowing when to speak up say something and knowing what to say um  kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down  but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had um  one of my weaknesses  i tend to be  i guess  a little more withdrawn sometimes um  and thats something ive been working on like ive taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team  um  but i think something good about that is i tend to be a very good listener  um  i think im like extremely responsible um  i have a lot of experience and this is something that i think will help further my career goals and something im really excited about learning about and so ill put a lot of effort into this project ,3.7256960304,0,good um im junior mit im major environmental engineering um im take class semester hydrology environmental transport um ive do internships previously environmental restoration company also participate research last summer um id like go grad school graduate environmental enginneering um semester become president woman independent live group um house manager last semester ive work lot problem within house try kind get right atmosphere house um house manager um organize work week begin year time theres member house everybody get together um work house paint room like fix school year start organize assigned job people facilitate um im also row team im sure exactly youre look guess second boat last year lot problem throughout season kind like would go race would okay werent performing standard big struggle try figure kind help turn attitude around boat um finally able pull last race semifinal patriot league think right mix like know speak say something know say um kind speak let people know like put people let people know way potential um one weaknesses tend guess little withdrawn sometimes um thats something ive work like ive take leadership house row team um think something good tend good listener um think im like extremely responsible um lot experience something think help career goal something im really excite learning ill put lot effort project
p21,um  pretty good um   yeah so  um  my name is dina wong im a student at mit im in my third year im majoring in course six seven which is biological enginum  biologicum  computational biology um its pretty new so it only like existed my freshman year so yeah  so ive been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes um in my free time i like to  um  write for the tech and a be edit  um articles at the  um the student newspaper  for the student newspaper um i also like to bake and like um like exercising and running  stuff like that so currently im looking for an internship for the summer um  i actually um  im exploring like the industry side of um like computer science ummm and i think that if i find a position or if i find like the industry side like really suits me that i would want to go for like um being hired by a company after i graduate ok soo this i guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the tech so a what happens is  um  like um  for my section i have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time so  um  one time i demonstrated leadership was in getting a um  column for for the campus life section so there was a um  the precedent of the panhellenic society um want to have like a column in the tech for greek life and so um  i negotiated with her to like um  sort to arrange how the column would work  because like um  i guess we both had the same like um  intent of how we should like publish articles  but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she  if your original idea was that she wanted to  i could  it was kind of like advertisement in the tech and um  people like  like the tech is a newspaper you dont like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um  write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey hmm  ahum i guess again probably using um  let me seeok so i guess again on  for the tech cause its like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular um  i guess um  what happened was um  shit  um i really dont know how to answer these type of questions sorry um umok i guess ill go back to high school then so in high school i was on the cross country team and um  so what happened was we a like were  were competing right so we um  so we had to like  um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the  um so theres a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was  i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um  and the girls team was like less motivated and wha  and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut  take short cuts and stuff like that um  i guess what happened was my um  there was another student on the team who was also  who was also like really motivated and i wanted to improve running so i think initially i guess we sort of tried asking people like hey um  could you not do that  but eventually what happened was i guess we  me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way  like i mean theres  theres motivating people  but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so i guess thats what happened ok  um  i would  let me think one of my  i guess one weakness i have is um  well mit is full of smart people right um  if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and i mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff  so because of the like abundance of geniuses i sometimes i feel like im not as at their level so um  i guess what i try  what i try to do is like i  i was  feeling badly  but then i realized well first of all i guess everybody has to start somewhere ive been like training my own skills like  reach up to the  to learn more in depth and eventually ill get that good  just takes like practice and ive also been like just sort of telling myself that its  to like just apply to things and like dont  and i guess sort of fake it till you make it right so make like um  project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come well um  so ive been learning a lot about um  computer science since i was here ive um  i am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the tech i always like am reliably like editing everything  getting thing in time  on deadline though if you gave me an assignment then i would reliably like a work on it and um and i  and not procrastinate or anything like that um im pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at mit and um i also um  i would a really enjoy working and contributing to the google community as a person and a i hope that a  i would be able to produce um  good products ,2.80873146245,0,um pretty good um yeah um name dina wong im student mit im third year im major course six seven biological enginum biologicum computational biology um pretty new like exist freshman year yeah ive taking lot computer science technology class um free time like um write tech edit um article um student newspaper student newspaper um also like bake like um like exercise run stuff like currently im look internship summer um actually um im explore like industry side um like computer science ummm think find position find like industry side like really suit would want go like um hire company graduate ok soo guess happen quite bit stint um campus life editor tech happen um like um section make sure publication like go time um one time demonstrate leadership get um column campus life section um precedent panhellenic society um want like column tech greek life um negotiate like um sort arrange column would work like um guess like um intent like publish article ideas slightly different mine original idea want could kind like advertisement tech um people like like tech newspaper dont like necessarily want article like advertising sorority make deal like um write article would personal side like um avertisey hmm ahum guess probably use um let seeok guess tech cause like major leadership pretty main extracurricular um guess um happen um shit um really dont know answer type question sorry um umok guess ill go back high school high school cross country team um happen like compete right um like um train group team sport happen kind um there girls team boys team like um boy team guess people boys like motivated thing like like would um girl team like less motivate wha since less motivate would stuff like coach ask like run around block would like sort cut take short cut stuff like um guess happen um another student team also also like really motivate want improve run think initially guess sort try ask people like hey um could eventually happen guess motivate girl train boys team really way like mean there theres motivate people sense like want guess thats happen ok um would let think one guess one weakness um well mit full smart people right um everybody like always like amaze product project mean like cod since like nine year old stuff like abundance genius sometimes feel like im level um guess try try like feel badly realize well first guess everybody start somewhere ive like train skill like reach learn depth eventually ill get good take like practice ive also like sort tell like apply thing like dont guess sort fake till make right make like um project image like confidence probably come well um ive learning lot um computer science since ive um pretty reliable person like example tech always like reliably like edit everything get thing time deadline though give assignment would reliably like work um procrastinate anything like um im pretty good learning demonstrate ability succeed mit um also um would really enjoy work contribute google community person hope would able produce um good product
p22,im good how are you ok um  im a junior in aerospace engineering  um  im originally from kansas city  um  and i was born on the east coast im currently deciding whether or not i want to go into aerospace industry or go into consulting or another aviationrelated field im minoring in management  uh  so  right now im actually quite involved with the global poverty initiative here at mit  and im currently the director of action under gpi  global poverty initiative  so im currently in charge of the projects we are involved with abroad  so that includes projects in mexico  service projects in central mexico as well as a project with a domestican ngo in india that works with domestic workers in setting up domestic workers with local employers  and training women  and working with employeremployee relationships um  most of my work has been on the mexico project  and i led a team  i actually have traveled down three times  and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now  and i oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built fourteen greenhouses as well as conducted classes at the secondary school as well as classes for adults in both computers and english that was really validating um  well  most of the challenges that ive faced with a team have been with my projects in mexico  um  so  probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members  because when we went there  we had originally thought  we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and biodigesters  which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste  and when we got there  we talked to lots of community members first of all  they can be rather skeptical of outsides coming in  so we first had to earn their trust  and we had to establish that we werent going to  um  just come in and give them something and leave this wasnt going to be a handout  yeah sometimes i can be disorganized i mean  i think everyone struggles with that a little bit  but the way i try to deal with thatrecently ive taken to becoming a list person laughs in order for me to ensure that i get things done  i always get things done  but  you know  when you leave things for the last minute  sometimes the quality of your work is not always the best  i think i have a diverse skill set  and i have very diverse background working with other cultures  not only in mexico  but ive had experiences in europe and in china im biracial myself  and i think i have a very unique background  and especially as an engineer whos interested in going into consulting  and i have work experience at spacex and nasa and  um  other companies  ,4.75560066436,1,im good ok um im junior aerospace engineering um im originally kansas city um bear east coast im currently decide whether want go aerospace industry go consult another aviationrelated field im minoring management uh right im actually quite involved global poverty initiative mit im currently director action gpi global poverty initiative im currently charge project involve abroad include project mexico service project central mexico well project domestican ngo india work domestic worker set domestic worker local employer train woman work employeremployee relationship um work mexico project lead team actually travel three time greenhouse initiative main goal right oversee team four people two separate trip build fourteen greenhouse well conduct class secondary school well class adults computer english really validate um well challenge ive face team project mexico um probably large challenge get work across culture identify community member go originally think brainstorm project idea like solar oven greenhouses biodigesters use make fertilizer natural waste get talked lot community member first rather skeptical outside come first earn trust establish werent go um come give something leave wasnt go handout yeah sometimes disorganized mean think everyone struggle little bit way try deal thatrecently ive take become list person laugh order ensure get thing do always get thing do know leave thing last minute sometimes quality work always best think diverse skill set diverse background work culture mexico ive experience europe china im biracial think unique background especially engineer who interested go consult work experience spacex nasa um company
p24,im doing very well how are you im currently a junior at mit im studying biology ummm i am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine  but i dont know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side  but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that so  within the broader field but im not sure specifically what path yet  umm  okay so umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school i actually went on a leadership trip um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to israel for the summer  and it was the first time id ever been  which was very exciting um and it was a very cool experience cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills  but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like  someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water and  you know  make sure the groups staying together and things like that  um so that was definitely something that i think impacted me a lot and i think  you know  in other leadership roles  you know  even in a small group project or something a lot of the time i find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying  okay  we were in a tough spot like that before how did we kinda rally the group back together something like that umm  sure so  a time when i was working on a team so i think  um  this situation arises a lot of times in lab  so i was  um  this past summer i was back in israel and working in a lab at the hebrew university um  and it was a pretty small lab i was working um for one of the postocs and then there are about four other people in the lab and so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of  okay  we dont have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment can i borrow this from this lab  can someone check down the hall  if maybe they have this  and just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done um and then it was also interesting cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab um cause there were some israelis that were working there and then one of the phd students was from russia  and then two of the postocs were from india um and so the common language among them was english  but in sort of a brokendown manner in different ways so that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating english to english for people and checking emails and making sure they made sense  and things like that sure uh  i think sometimes i tend to be a little bit on the shy side especially um like if im the person coming into a new group or a new experience and i think i just kind of have to remind myself like  theres a reason why im here and i can add something to the experience  even if its not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role like for example  the lab last summer  i was the only undergraduate working there and so that kind of brought out that shyer side cause i walked in and  you know  everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields um  so just kind of keep  keeping up the reminders that like  im here to get something out of this experience and hopefully i can help out the lab  while at the same time realizing that  you know  im not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today and thats okay  and  you know  i still need to feel comfortable here i need to add what i can  and then the rest will fall into place when it does and i think just  you know  keeping those reminders coming that i dont have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back  relax see what i  what i can add to the table without freaking out that its not enough um  i think for me where im  where i am at this point  where im deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route the more time i spend in a hospital setting i think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if its the oneonone patient care that i care more about  or if its the sort of overarching like how are these people being cured more from a scientific standpoint um  and i think just sort of that openmindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot because you know its always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level and someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two ,4.85459639205,1,im well im currently junior mit im study biology ummm interested pursue sort future medicine dont know necessarily like medschool route research side know patient care drug thing like within broad field im sure specifically path yet okay summer sophomore year high school actually go leadership trip um uh summer camp camp part foundation actually go trip israel summer first time id ever excite um cool experience cause teaching lot leadership skill also lot know daily activity like go really long hikes thing kind bring innate like someone make sure everyone bring enough water know make sure group stay together thing like um definitely something think impact lot think know leadership role know even small group project something lot time find reflect back trip kind say okay tough spot like kinda rally group back together something like sure time work team think um situation arise lot time lab um past summer back israel work lab hebrew university um pretty small lab work um one postocs four people lab thing like kind come time would matter okay dont exact material need experiment borrow lab someone check hall maybe kind group mentality make sure everyone get experiment do um also interest cause lot language barrier go lab um cause israeli work one phd student russia two postocs india um common language among english sort brokendown manner different way kind interesting also come sort step role almost like translate english english people check email make sure make sense thing like sure uh think sometimes tend little bit shy side especially um like im person come new group new experience think kind remind like there reason im add something experience even major sort leadership necessarily role like example lab last summer undergraduate work kind bring shy side cause walk know everyone already work much old much establish field um kind keep keep reminder like im get something experience hopefully help lab time realize know im necessarily go come big breakthrough today thats okay know still need feel comfortable need add rest fall place think know keep reminder come dont like person solve problem right away kind help take step back relax see add table without freak enough um think im point im decide sort go medical school route research route time spend hospital setting think definitely enable kind make distinction oneonone patient care care sort overarch like people cure scientific standpoint um think sort openmindedness towards side help hospital lot know always good people interact pure doctor

p25,um im good how are you um im a core 16 here at mit  which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering um im a junior um and my experience has been last summer i worked with nasa glenn research center doing  ah  interplanetary rover work um i was  um so  that it could be recovered by  um  the people who are using it um  and i personally worked on the steerable parafoil parachute for that um yes i can um when we were working on the dropsonde project which i mentioned before  um  there was um  some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it um  because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time um so  it was fairlyit takes um  not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height so we had to find a really good drop location um and we were having a lot of trouble with that and  um  wewe were pursuing some options with working with nasa  um  but it didnt look like they were gonna work out and i took the initiative  um  and i went and i contact the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously there in the summer um  well i guess i should probably pick a different time that i was working on a team um so  um  whenfor the venus rover  which was the other project that i worked on last summer um  we had  um  we basically started just with with nothing um  because  um  this  this ideas really like in early design phases its not liketheres no venus rover being built by any team its just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a venus rover  the turbine did which i was happy about um yeah i am not extremely well organized um  so  ahh  yeah my my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and i have trouble meeting deadlines um but i um  overcome it just by recognizing something thatrecognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and i will miss deadlines if i dont really pay attention to it um  so  i do writing down deadlines keeping a google calendar um trying to keep myself on top of things um i think you should hire me because  um  i am intelligent and hard working um  and i thinki think my grades at mit really prove that i am intelligent and hard working um  and  i think that  as well as that i also have the experience that you would want at jpo working on interplanetary rovers  ive done that before also worked on teams um  to try to accomplish goals um  so i think that really i am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position ,4.65014861926,0,um im good um im core mit aeronautical astronautical engineering um im junior um experience last summer work nasa glenn research center ah interplanetary rover work um um could recover um people use um personally work steerable parafoil parachute um yes um work dropsonde project mention um um question whether gon na able get good drop site um order test navigation system work thing fly significant period time um fairlyit take um long thing fall reasonable height find really good drop location um lot trouble um wewe pursue option work nasa um didnt look like gon na work take initiative um go contact owner airport skydive previously summer um well guess probably pick different time work team um um whenfor venus rover project work last summer um um basically start nothing um um idea really like early design phase liketheres venus rover build team people like sit work equation figure would feasible venus rover turbine happy um yeah extremely well organize um ahh yeah work tend little bit mess trouble meet deadline um um overcome recognize something thatrecognizing something happen work become sloppy miss deadline dont really pay attention um write deadline keep google calendar um try keep top thing um think hire um intelligent hard work um thinki think grade mit really prove intelligent hard work um think well also experience would want jpo work interplanetary rover ive do also work team um try accomplish goal um think really pretty well qualified applicant position
p27,im doing well thank you um  im currently a junior studying chemistry in biology  at massachusetts institute of technology im primarily interested in biochemistry research  pacifically  how small molecules interact with the body  um  and produce physiological effects  ive done research as an undergraduate  um  in the lab thats chemistry and biological  um  engineering so ive been able to work at a chemical  biology interface ive demonstrated leadership through my role in dorms house government ive been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years um  so through that ive been able to work with others  and um  work with the  like  other members of house government as well as the administration um  and bring  um  concerns from residents to the administration  and represent them     ive um  been able to work on teams  um  during my undergraduate classes  we  um  in our laboratory classes in the chemistry department we generally work  um  in small groups of two or three so theres definitely been challenges in those situations where  for example  team member accidentally does something wrong  like  cost us a lot of product  or makes our experiment go wrong  and i found it helpful to kind of  be like  able to put  you know  aside my annoying side when someones done in the moment  and figure how to move forward um  as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently  try to see how to go forward with that  i would say my weakness is actually leadership experience  because i havent had a lot of it um  i also havent had much experience working in a team environment  but i have been seeking out opportunities to improve this  um  looking for even more of a role in house government this year  um  and actually running for house president how soon to try to get a leadership position so im trying to more experience in those areas i think you should hire me because i bring experience from  um  from my education at mit  which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment  to work hard and be able to solve problems  and ive demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that ive already done  ,5.35963065424,1,im well thank um im currently junior study chemistry biology massachusetts institute technology im primarily interested biochemistry research pacifically small molecule interact body um produce physiological effect ive do research undergraduate um lab thats chemistry biological um engineering ive able work chemical biology interface ive demonstrate leadership role dorm house government ive dieting chair environmental chair almost two year um ive able work others um work like member house government well administration um bring um concern resident administration represent ive um able work team um undergraduate class um laboratory class chemistry department generally work um small group two three there definitely challenge situation example team member accidentally something wrong like cost u lot product make experiment go wrong found helpful kind like able put know aside annoy side someone do moment figure move forward um oppose frustrated fact currently try see go forward would say weakness actually leadership experience havent lot um also havent much experience work team environment seek opportunity improve um look even role house government year um actually run house president soon try get leadership position im try experience area think hire bring experience um education mit really prepared rigorous work environment work hard able solve problem ive demonstrate work internship research ive already do
p29,good thanks um im a junior at mit um im majoring in biological engineering i play for the womens varsity volleyball team at mit um and also then also fairly involved with my sorority at mit alpha phi im the vice president of the chapter of operations so im pretty involved with the house maintenance and things like that um i think my most active role in leadership would be within my sorority um its my job to make sure that everything is operating smoothly so thats includes coordinating with our chef like meals that are working  that all our facilities including our washers and driers and everything are up and running weve had like issues with refrigerators um like last year when the power went off there was a lot of issues with that  that we had to kind of adjust so i think i being being able to maintain calm and like make sure everything was dealt with a timely and efficient manner um so the obvious team choice would be my volleyball team um and we actually get along pretty well so theres not too many conflicts but i think this is silly as it sounds one of the things is what we eat after meals or after games um and so i think its kind of nice sometimes ill just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games and so that way i kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what were gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team like what would you like to do after the game and getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that im getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that so uh i think that way its just being able to get a couple of different opinions  come to a conclusion before um making a decision thats been pretty successful one of my weaknesses might be um maybe voicing my opinion all the time sometimes if im in a group with a lot of like loud personalities i might have um an opinion on a matter but not always want to voice it in the most i wont um word my feelings in the best way or be able to convey exactly my emotions um so i think working to do that and i think just through getting more leadership exposure and really pushing myself to get out there has been helping me overcome that i think that from freshman to now junior year that it definitely by taking more leadership roles on ive been able to become more vocal person to kind of like express my concerns i think you should hire me because i think i have a lot of uh technical or skills both um like bases off of my academic performance s i would have good but also more i feel like i work well with others im able to take initiative and if theres ever some sort of concern ive never had a pro with people coming to me to discuss it um i think im good at recognizing problems early before they get too uh become a good a big problem um and kind of address them in a very professional manner and fix it um the problem can go over smoothly ,5.01152235113,1,good thanks um im junior mit um im major biological engineering play womens varsity volleyball team mit um also also fairly involved sorority mit alpha phi im vice president chapter operation im pretty involve house maintenance thing like um think active role leadership would within sorority um job make sure everything operate smoothly thats include coordinate chef like meal work facility include washer drier everything run weve like issue refrigerator um like last year power go lot issue kind adjust think able maintain calm like make sure everything dealt timely efficient manner um obvious team choice would volleyball team um actually get along pretty well theres many conflict think silly sound one thing eat meal game um think kind nice sometimes ill speak one two player r come consensus really discuss team game way kind get feel like amongst u like team would like receptive something like come kind consensus gon na instead open entire team like would like game get know different opinion deal im get like small set like know option people dietary restriction thing like uh think way able get couple different opinion come conclusion um make decision thats pretty successful one weakness might um maybe voice opinion time sometimes im group lot like loud personality might um opinion matter always want voice wont um word feeling best way able convey exactly emotions um think work think get leadership exposure really push get help overcome think freshman junior year definitely take leadership role ive able become vocal person kind like express concern think hire think lot uh technical skill um like base academic performance would good also feel like work well others im able take initiative there ever sort concern ive never pro people come discuss um think im good recognizing problem early get uh become good big problem um kind address professional manner fix um problem go smoothly
p3,good you yeah  sorry  i was think i was late i totally  like  messed up i thought we were at the media lab but    ahh  hmm so  uhh  i would would say that the job im interviewing for  lets stay down here so  yeay   im chase  and i guess  um  i dont know i really enjoy computers and outdoors  thats thats generally what i give people um  so in both of these  um  in computers mainly  uhh  at mit i think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics       and computational photography as well so its actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems  um  like really deep programming like c  im actually getting more interested in whereas before when i came to mit i had no idea about this stuff and i just did a lot of webdevelopment umm  otherwise i just    i really just enjoy working on random projects going to acathons sp a lot and hanging out with people umm  yeah just building cool things uhh  otherwise  uhh  my main thing i do afterwards is ultimate frisbee  which i really enjoy uhh  actually that would probably be    i would actually put this on frisbee uhh  so i started the frisbee club in my high school  um  my junior year  and  umm  basically it was just a bunch of my friends we used to play around a lot  and we said  hey  why dont we just make this a team it was about 15 or 20 of us umm  so i became captain and what that entailed was getting people to practices every day or maybe three times a week  depending on  like  how peoples schedules were but it was definitely tricky because  i mean  we had to get  you know  at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game  because you need 7 on each side umm  so  uhh  getting all this organized like everyday was umm  definitely like pretty hard to do and i had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play umm  and by the end  uhh  we went to a tournament in texas      which is where im from umm  and we got 5th my junior year and 3rd my senior year which is great without a coach or anything umm  just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah uhh  hmm  ok so lets lets go with robotics that was one of the classes i was in  uhh  last semester so  umm  basically  uhh  the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots and figuring out  umm  you know  just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it  doing vision and such umm  so finally at the very end of the  umm  uhh  class we had to make our own robots and so what i did there  umm  basically  uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff umm  and i guess  uhh  what i wanted to do was  umm  basically go ahead with everything wed already done uhh  and just push forward with that and just finish off basically and what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom umm  so what we ended up doing  i actually took their side  umm  and it worked out very well umm  we had  uhh  quite a few tricky problems involved like  umm  uhh  one really cool thing we worked on was figuring out exactly  umm  how the robot can see the world       and what we had with this  we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with we had a tile floor and then walls       everywhere umm  so what we were able to do is say  lets just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops so lets look at all the light in the picture and whenever we dont see any white  thats actually the bottom of the wall umm  yeah so then we basically took all these points that existed  that represented roughly the bottom of the wall  and then basically ran that through an algorhythm that created it  uhh  turned it into a line umm  so yeah that was that was kind of what it was and it worked really well in the end we actually had this vision turned on which is really tricky and    i think the first time theyd actually had  umm  some something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning umm  actually local relocalization in the world yeah ok  uhh  hmm one of my weaknesses umm  i would go with  umm     umm   yeah i shouldve had a better answer for this question   umm  i guess    i dont know if i can plan to overcome it laughing i dont know i i id actually say  umm  i i wish i was a lot better in working in working in teams  umm  so  i actually really enjoy working in teams in general and thats  umm  actually been one of my biggest focuses at mit because i just know everyone is like really great at everything umm  but being able to  umm  basically inspire people to do stuff that i think is a good idea  uhh  i have found that im not the best at basically umm  uhh  i mean just like  just just various aspects of just everything you know  like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know  ive got like various ideas that i need to get across to people but sometimes people dont agree with me and       i either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas umm  so  i guess i guess my plan to overcome this  uhh  so far has basically just been a lot of practice       and just doing more  uhh  basically again  like ive been doing a lot of teamwork in general  i do really enjoy it so i think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me  umm  so hopefully i can inspire others umm  laughs uhh  i guess because  umm  i i would probably say the one word comes down to passion umm  i whatever im doing  i make sure  umm  to do it with everything that i have and im im basically always thinking about the problems that im working on umm i i i generally have like a pretty small scope of problems as well  that i always try to narrow it down im not i cant take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them if im reading a book  im only reading like one or two books umm  but with this  umm  i dont know i i ive found it so far to be really helpful umm  i think my passion generally overflows to other people umm  i i think im frequently jumping around  uhh  when im doing stuff       and like explaining stuff and like listening to people umm  so i think i i i bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes im always looking at new stuff  learning new stuff and and teaching people about it  umm  and you know just enjoy making stuff ,3.9121988684,0,good yeah sorry think late totally like mess thought medium lab ahh hmm would would say job im interview let stay yeay im chase guess um dont know really enjoy computer outdoors thats thats generally give people um um computer mainly mit think favorite class actually graphic computational photography well actually really interesting get harder problem um like really deep programming like c im actually get interested whereas come mit idea stuff lot webdevelopment otherwise really enjoy work random project go acathons sp lot hang people yeah build cool thing otherwise main thing afterwards ultimate frisbee really enjoy actually would probably would actually put frisbee start frisbee club high school um junior year basically bunch friend use play around lot say hey dont make team u become captain entail get people practice every day maybe three time week depend like people schedule definitely tricky mean get know least people field able actually play game need side get organize like everyday definitely like pretty hard get people passionate enough wanting play every time need play end go tournament texas im get th junior year rd senior year great without coach anything lot play around friend yeah hmm ok let let go robotics one class last semester basically first half class learn general robot figure know like electronics first actually computer sense behind vision finally end class make robot basically meeting figure type robot would build stuff guess want basically go ahead everything wed already do push forward finish basically team member want actually redo everything start bottom end actually take side work well quite tricky problem involve like one really cool thing work figure exactly robot see world tile floor kind cheat tile floor wall everywhere able say let color tile floor wherever color stops let look light picture whenever dont see white thats actually bottom wall yeah basically take point exist represent roughly bottom wall basically run algorhythm create turned line yeah kind work really well end actually vision turn really tricky think first time theyd actually something like instead look ball path plan actually local relocalization world yeah ok hmm one weakness would go yeah shouldve good answer question guess dont know plan overcome laugh dont know id actually say wish lot well work work team actually really enjoy work team general thats actually one big focus mit know everyone like really great everything able basically inspire people stuff think good idea find im best basically mean like various aspect everything know like work social club throw offense general student know ive got like various idea need get across people sometimes people dont agree either persuasive something come good idea guess guess plan overcome far basically lot practice basically like ive lot teamwork general really enjoy think come practice conscious people stuff well inspire hopefully inspire others laugh guess would probably say one word come passion whatever im make sure everything im im basically always think problem im work generally like pretty small scope problem well always try narrow im cant take many problem time try solve im read book im reading like one two book dont know ive found far really helpful think passion generally overflow people think im frequently jump around im stuff like explain stuff like listen people think bring kind liveliness place also passion go im always look new stuff learn new stuff teach people know enjoy make stuff
p30,pretty well how are you um  im nikki im a course 6 major at mit this year i live at east campus um  what do you want to know im from minnesota umum i was in apo i was the fellowship vice president for a time i was responsible for organizing the xx basically its limited to three sections friendship  leadership and service it was on my xx organizing the events thathelped to foster friendship among the brothers so we had this project a few weeks ago it was a xx of xx and one of our groupmates did the whole thing yeah um so wethe other two of us we talked among ourselves to figure out what like had happened exactly  because both of us are just kind of xx really quickly and then arranged a meeting with the ta xx  to see if we could work out a solution and at the end it worked out okay it wasnt the best  obviously  because we hadnt gotten to do the work resolved it i havent had this kind of interview in foreverim going to ask you to code im really quiet i just speak really quietly and its because in my head it sounds louder than i guess it is i work on it i try to project and all that i ask people to tell me if im being too quiet  cause i cant xx its a real problem though for what uhm  because i learn really quickly um i bring a very positive attitude to the job and i like to have fun with what i do and i work hard at it and i dont what to let people down xx ,3.59713349546,0,pretty well um im nikki im course major mit year live east campus um want know im minnesota umum apo fellowship vice president time responsible organize xx basically limit three section friendship leadership service xx organize event thathelped foster friendship among brother project week ago xx xx one groupmates whole thing yeah um wethe two u talk among figure like happen exactly u kind xx really quickly arrange meet ta xx see could work solution end work okay wasnt best obviously hadnt gotten work resolve havent kind interview foreverim go ask code im really quiet speak really quietly head sound louder guess work try project ask people tell im quiet cause cant xx real problem though learn really quickly um bring positive attitude job like fun work hard dont let people xx
p31,good yep uh  well im a junior im an mit student um  im majoring in both math and computer science uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about cool  well im really interested in distributed systems actually and thats more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when i look at companies is parallel computing um  i actually did an internship last summer with amazon and uh for them i ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform im also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in c well  uh  this was in high school but in high school i was the  uh  president of our robotics team as well as the  uh  in the earlier years the head of  respectively the  the  uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team uh  and you know that was a good leadership experience uh  ive also been in  uh  in 6172 we have group projects  theyre only two people  but um  in some of the projects ive been the person doing a lot of the organizing uh  yeah  um are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in a working with people challenge  okay well  um  in my 6172 class im taking right now i was working with jason he is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness um  of improvement and we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately five hundredfold yeah  it was pretty intense and we as such like had to sort of try and paralyze the work and you know it was pretty hard because the code  like  merging two code documents is never fun and there was really only one document we were working on what ended up happening is that i spent most of the time uh driving which is to say coding  him watching  verifying my algorithm it was stressful because it was getting close to the deadline and if we didnt finish this optimization wed have to turn in an old version which was only ten times faster as opposed to five hundred times faster we ended up getting it not five hundred times faster  but one hundred times faster i was quite pleased working with him was sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix the technical problem as fast as possible given that we had two peoples worth of manhours but only n actual hours um  and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was interesting uh  i  when i get stressed tend to get a little snippy with people im working with i think it is not uncommon um  but definitely when im  especially when im tired its like 4 am in the morning and im working with people when theyre trying to explain something to me or im trying to explain something to them theres like inherent overhead and that can be very frustrating it causes me to like  be short with people when like theyre trying to explain things to me or im explaining things to them and its something im working on because it doesnt actually make communication more effective  it just makes everyone unhappy um one of  so  theres a couple things one is that like i have to stay up late working on things so i inevitably get practice working at not being snippy um  but also like having recognized that this is something that i do  something that is not effective for communication  uh  i have been trying to pay attention to  um  you know  my tone of voice  my friendliness and ive been trying to take the approach that when i do have to try to communicate in these situations  to like  optimize by minimizing the communication needed and being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication because even if i need to be like  working hard and stressing out about the work  the communication portion doesnt need to take up much time and so if it takes like twice as long  it doesnt matter  because thats not the time you need to optimize i think you should hire me because im technically qualified  i get along well with people  i am interested in these fields like  im excited about computer science its like what i want to do its a large part of who i am  the math and computer science part of me and as a result  im going to enjoy work  and enjoy working with people um  also the people i spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people ill be interacting with at work and so  it tends to work out pretty well in my previous internship with amazon my team liked me a lot because im pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people bake food  you know so i  yeah  you know i will solve your technical problems and i will get along with the team ,4.72572824874,1,good yep uh well im junior im mit student um im major math computer science uh sort skill interest look find cool well im really interested distribute system actually thats research interest sort application generally tend look company parallel compute um actually internship last summer amazon uh end lot parallel compute hoodoo platform im also take performance engineering class lot parallelism c well uh high school high school uh president robotics team well uh early year head respectively uh mechanical engineering team mechanical arm team uh know good leadership experience uh ive also uh group project theyre two people um project ive person lot organize uh yeah um interested technical challenge like work people challenge okay well um class im take right work jason friend mine work first project try improve speed order get benchmark like good fastness um improvement prioritize different choice term might actually speed code approximately five hundredfold yeah pretty intense like sort try paralyze work know pretty hard code like merge two code document never fun really one document work end happen spent time uh drive say cod watch verify algorithm stressful get close deadline didnt finish optimization wed turn old version ten time faster opposed five hundred time faster end get five hundred time faster one hundred time faster quite pleased work sort work strategy fix technical problem fast possible give two people worth manhours n actual hour um think solution technical problem interest uh get stress tend get little snippy people im work think uncommon um definitely im especially im tire like morning im work people theyre try explain something im try explain something there like inherent overhead frustrate cause like short people like theyre try explain thing im explain thing something im work doesnt actually make communication effective make everyone unhappy um one theres couple thing one like stay late work thing inevitably get practice work snippy um also like recognize something something effective communication uh try pay attention um know tone voice friendliness ive try take approach try communicate situation like optimize minimize communication need expressively relaxed period communication even need like work hard stress work communication portion doesnt need take much time take like twice long doesnt matter thats time need optimize think hire im technically qualify get along well people interested field like im excite computer science like want large part math computer science part result im go enjoy work enjoy work people um also people spend time outside work tend similar kind people kind people ill interact work tends work pretty well previous internship amazon team like lot im pretty lay back enjoy joke around people bake food know yeah know solve technical problem get along team
p32, good  how are you  so im a junior in chemical engineering  im very interested in energy application so um from alternative energy to more traditional sources so basically oil fossil fuels  um and kind of optimizing that industry i think theres a lot of potential there so thats thats where my main interest is  yeah  um so im uh vice president of corporalations sp for the society of woman engineers  and um we just held in september a career fair banquet  so we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair  um and its its a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner    so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair  and and to just give people a chance to talk  um and so so i was working with a committee of six people and which i was the leader of and um i think one thing that i i really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on  um so one of the one of things that happened in the previous years when i was one of the team and not leading the  team was it became very disorganized because we didnt know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing  and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and i wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well so in the end it ended up running very well  um  and um kind of we all got to have dinner to so that was awesome um  so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering  um asks us to design uh chemical plant in one of the uh software programs we use um  and so its a very big project  but its very modular  so you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the sp separator um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project  and so one challenge that i faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of  slacking off um so kind of to addrses that problem i sat down with him  had a conversation with him about it  you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project  the deadline is coming  um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are  and it turned out that um he wasnt very um he wasnt very comfortable writing the code in the program    so he didnt want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute  i think  um kind of within my personality  i hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and  a lot of times i dont um  realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option  um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when i was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept i kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people   in that company and figuring ouit what i wanted to do and um i think in that circumstance it would have been better after i had accepted an offer i i got other offers that i of course couldnt consider because i was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out  and to just communicate with other people saying that you know i really do think that pushing the deadline is the best  option in this circumstance  so kind of this year now i definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision  um and it has worked out really well actually  i i was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers i received but over this last weekend i actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind  both companies that i was deciding between was at the conference  and talking to the representatives really helped me  so im glad that i waited to you know hit the buttons  i think that i have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are  in your job description   but also kind of the enthusiasms t he willingness to contribute my ideas to the  uh huh  discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate i think ,5.39823147181,1,good im junior chemical engineering im interested energy application um alternative energy traditional source basically oil fossil fuel um kind optimize industry think there lot potential thats thats main interest yeah um im uh vice president corporalations sp society woman engineer um hold september career fair banquet dinner people follow career fair um huge event organize sense student need match company suit interest dinner goal kind relax networking event know hecticness carrerr fair give people chance talk um work committee six people leader um think one thing really make sure event go smoothly delegate task early um one one thing happen previous year one team lead team become disorganized didnt know task people end end work throughout event keep thing run smoothly want team member able sit dinner well end end run well um um kind get dinner awesome um one senior design senior one design class within chemical engineering um ask u design uh chemical plant one uh software program use um big project modular somebody work distillation column somebody work sp separator um one challenge um within um make sure everyone keep um part project one challenge face project make sure one particular person thou rally involve um lot work today cant really afford

p33,im  uh  pretty good the weathers nice  uh  outside  okay  so im a junior im a junior at it going to graduate  uh  a semester early  actually  so im going to be graduating next fall um because uhi  ive been doing my  my work pretty quickly i guess so i so uh i can graduate early  thats a good thing um im interested in going into nutrition in the long run uh  whether it be through medical school or  you know  even  a certification whatever  but i uh in the meantime  i want to get into life sciences consulting and i want to um explore the field and and and uh yeahdo it as as soon as i can  pretty  much  as long as i can in the field um being successful uh  and getting somewhere uh so uh  yeah  okay  so i am president of the endometrius society  and last year we organized a networking event so uh that  that comprised of not only students but also  like  working professionals in the boston area  so basically i got in touch with and invited every single armenian that i knew  in the boston area  and it ended up being a hundred plus event that we actually coordinated in one of the dorms here in bexley hall  so it was also a lot of logistical um  you know  like  practice  getting over uh  getting around the rules and stuff with capacity and everything and whether or not to serve alcohol and all that stuff so uh that that was a very big event and uh it was very successfully because people were still talking about it today so thank you okay  so  im also involved in mit undergraduate research journal  and uh last spring we we we we publish twice a year  at the end of each semester  and last spring um we were a little late in our uh  in our uh  timeline  so  it was kind of near finals week  and we still hadnt gotten anything published so  uh  sorry this was last fall  so we still had the spring semester to uh sort of remediate our uh error so um  we kind of  um  all  you know  pitched in together  and i guess the main thing we had to uh draw upon was each others initiative  like in the whole process  and motivation  and motivation  you know  for some people  its more selfcentered  and for others  its more of a community motivation  you know and we each had to tap into our individual editors motivation you know  what kind of people they were  what they were looking for  et cetera  so we had to get people kind of  uh  self started in a way and uh  yeah  we we got to work really quickly and uh and and we had it published by like the first two weeks of the spring semester so uh yeah yeah it was a good skill that i picked up  kind of  how to tap into peoples sense of initiative and stuff so  yeah uh   yeah so  uh  one of my weakness i think is  uh  like well  shyness you know  um um and i may see a little like confident  you know  on the outside  but um i definitely have my moments where im like you know  i just  freeze  and i feel like so  you know  like i cant talk to anyone  pretty much  you know  and its like  its like maybe ten percent of the time that im like that  but uh i kinda want to like get rid of that completely  so  yeah im just im doing  im like putting myself into more like  challenging situations  socially and stuff  to kind of like overcome it so um  yeah  just  like  you know  taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way  to be social  and stuff  like going to parties  and just being used to being around people  because definitely at mit you can become  like  socially uh  you know  like  blocked away  so yeah  um  so i draw upon a lot of leadership experiences  with my enrollment at mit student groups  um  ive completed three years of mit without going insane  thats just a joke  but um  umand im very  you know  like  um im very organized  im a selfstarter  im  you know  i take initiative  ive organized a lot of events through these student groups  so im im um  im definitely able to take upon like large tasks with being organized  and you know very  like  having initiative so yeah ,5.07688543471,1,im uh pretty good weather nice uh outside okay im junior im junior go graduate uh semester early actually im go graduate next fall um uhi ive work pretty quickly guess uh graduate early thats good thing um im interested go nutrition long run uh whether medical school know even certification whatever uh meantime want get life science consult want um explore field uh yeahdo soon pretty much long field um successful uh get somewhere uh uh yeah okay president endometrius society last year organize networking event uh comprise student also like work professional boston area basically get touch invite every single armenian know boston area end hundred plus event actually coordinate one dorm bexley hall also lot logistical um know like practice get uh get around rule stuff capacity everything whether serve alcohol stuff uh big event uh successfully people still talk today thank okay im also involved mit undergraduate research journal uh last spring publish twice year end semester last spring um little late uh uh timeline kind near final week still hadnt gotten anything publish uh sorry last fall still spring semester uh sort remediate uh error um kind um know pitch together guess main thing uh draw upon others initiative like whole process motivation motivation know people selfcentered others community motivation know tap individual editor motivation know kind people look et cetera get people kind uh self start way uh yeah get work really quickly uh publish like first two week spring semester uh yeah yeah good skill pick kind tap people sense initiative stuff yeah uh yeah uh one weakness think uh like well shyness know um um may see little like confident know outside um definitely moment im like know freeze feel like know like cant talk anyone pretty much know like like maybe ten percent time im like uh kinda want like get rid completely yeah im im im like put like challenge situation socially stuff kind like overcome um yeah like know take advantage every opportunity come way social stuff like go party use around people definitely mit become like socially uh know like block away yeah um draw upon lot leadership experience enrollment mit student group um ive complete three year mit without go insane thats joke um umand im know like um im organize im selfstarter im know take initiative ive organize lot event student group im im um im definitely able take upon like large task organize know like initiative yeah
p34,im doing pretty well im a junior in course two  unknown word i just started going to last semester but i got very interested in product design when i took a class called product design it was really cool because we got to work in small teams to make our own projects so ours was a toy called con control  and my main role is to do a lot of the solid worksing so i make a lot of the cad 3d modeling so that we could make the physical components that didnt already exsist i really enjoyed that because its kind of an intersection between designing a part and engineering  which i have never really thought of until last year outside of classes i try to do a lot of design work as well  maybe in somewhat different fields like i work for the tech as a production editor so its a lot of making info graphics and laying out the entire newspaper and making it look really pretty its kind of a good break though from equations and things like that  i think a very recent example is i am going to be chair of my sorority so we just held an event called catwalk  which is ten months of planning  but it took a lot of delegation  a lot of staying on top of things because theres so many components they needed to coordinate we ended up having fourteen designers but we had to contact way more than that from around the boston area and the sorority has a hundred forty girls in it  so all of them has to participate in some way  whether its working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or logistics i personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization i had a cochair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on google docs to stay on top of things  if i may  ill go back to toy product design  cause i think that was a really good good example i think all of usit was a team of three freshmen and two sophomoresnone of us had that much experience with product design at all  so we were all bringing different skills to the table and different ideas  different preferences and visions for what we wanted to do  and they clashed a lot in the beginning it was really difficult for us  like our personalities clashed as well  not just our ideas  which was really difficult to work with because meetings were unproductive  and we just felt like we werent moving anywhere because other teams were moving forward with their ideas  prototyping things  and we were still arguing over what design would be most feasible  or what was interesting so we worked through that by justwe worked with our mentors  talking to them as kind of a mediator so it wasnt a completely selfmotivated resolution or selfi dont know how to describe it but it ended up working out  we all kind of slowed down  took a step back  and saw from eachothers perspectives  talked out very explicitly what the plus and minuses of each idea were and what our goals were  given the constraints of the class  being that we had a two hundred dollar budget and just a semester to complete it in and at this point  like a month left to go and in the end we just recognized eachothers strengths and we could each take on responsibility for a certain component of the toy  and figure out a way to just meld them all together into the final product and we did by the end we had something that we were really proud of like a lot of teams ended up relying a lot on their mentors to kind of do the project for them  but because we each wanted to take so much ownership of the project it was very much our own  and we were able to present it on the final day  and thats something that was very rewarding i think one of my weaknesses is myi forget what it is called oh  lack of assertiveness  or lack of confidence in a way like i always want to make sure that everyones ideas are heard  and i feel like lots of times i dont want to create conflict  so ill kind of back down after a little bit im very open to sharing my ideas  but if theres a lot of criticism then i will back down  and thats something that im working on a lot  like just trying to stand behind my own ideas  trying to be more objective about them so i have reasons to resent so that i dont feel like theres any reason for me to need to back down i think you should hire me because i am very passionate about product design i feel like its something that people told me when i started the mechanical engineering lessons  they were like oh  you just lit up and i can see that you found your passion here i feel like im very detail oriented  so im able to create cad models in a very methodical manner  instead of just drawing random things together im able to think of design for manufacturing overall  and not just what looks nice on paper  but whats actually practicable i think i am a great team player in that even though i can be passive sometimes  in a way its good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness  and different levels of confidence  because that way its not all like  butting heads all the time  and i think that as i improve in my own smoothly and not confrontationally with people  but also get things done very effectively    ,4.50915597265,0,im pretty well im junior course two unknown word start go last semester get interested product design take class call product design really cool get work small team make project toy call con control main role lot solid work make lot cad modeling could make physical component didnt already exsist really enjoy kind intersection design part engineering never really think last year outside class try lot design work well maybe somewhat different field like work tech production editor lot make info graphic lay entire newspaper making look really pretty kind good break though equation thing like think recent example go chair sorority hold event call catwalk ten month plan take lot delegation lot stay top thing theres many component need coordinate end fourteen designer contact way around boston area sorority hundred forty girl participate way whether work designer help create decoration scheme logistics personally think ran really smoothly result extreme organization cochair another girl help organize get good create tabs google doc stay top thing may ill go back toy product design cause think really good good example think usit team three freshman two sophomoresnone u much experience product design bring different skill table different idea different preference vision want clashed lot begin really difficult u like personality clash well idea really difficult work meeting unproductive felt like werent move anywhere team move forward idea prototyping thing still argue design would feasible interesting work justwe work mentor talk kind mediator wasnt completely selfmotivated resolution selfi dont know describe end work kind slow take step back saw eachothers perspective talk explicitly plus minus idea goal give constraint class two hundred dollar budget semester complete point like month leave go end recognize eachothers strength could take responsibility certain component toy figure way meld together final product end something really proud like lot team end rely lot mentor kind project want take much ownership project much able present final day thats something reward think one weaknesses myi forget call oh lack assertiveness lack confidence way like always want make sure everyones idea hear feel like lot time dont want create conflict ill kind back little bit im open share ideas there lot criticism back thats something im working lot like try stand behind idea try objective reason resent dont feel like there reason need back think hire passionate product design feel like something people tell started mechanical engineering lesson like oh lit see find passion feel like im detail orient im able create cad model methodical manner instead draw random thing together im able think design manufacture overall look nice paper whats actually practicable think great team player even though passive sometimes way good people different level aggressiveness different level confidence way like butt head time think improve smoothly confrontationally people also get thing do effectively
p35,im good how are you ok  well im a junior at mit and im currently studying computer science and biology its a new joint major with a minor in management so thats a little bit of my background um  last summer i worked at wells fargo bank in san francisco  i was in their principal investing group so  i was investing in a lot of longer term securities so  it was like buy side trading ok  so  my freshman year  um  i was doing this project called six four seventy and this is during iep its like a competition where youre supposed to get a team and design your on website so  it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before well  i had a little background but not much um  and  basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things and its iep  everyone is trying to have fun also then i was like guys we have deadlines we need to get a b in this so  basically i stepped into a leadership roll and i brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class it didnt win any of us awards but at least we finished it i guess that is kind of related to my previous example i can talk more in depth about it  i guess um  so  i guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly um  which none of us had ever programmed with  like  mysql or any of those languages before  you know so  um  i basically tried to delegate tasks so  i made one of my friends set up the  uh  get hub server and then another friend i said ok  just try to focus on like the matching algorithms then ill try to put all these things together and create  like  the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah so that was my team experience i think one of my weaknesses is  um  when i am working on a team sometimes i try to do too much myself um  like  sometimes  like  people are  say oh what can i help you with  but if they had previously shown inconsistency in the past  then ill try to get it done on my own and not really  like delegate things to them  so yeah thats something i need to work on i think uh  to overcome it  i am trying to be a better leader um  i am actually going through this leadership  uh  program right now its called cclp  so thats been helping me a lot with my leadership skills i think you should hire me because i have the necessary background experience um  from my past summers at  uh  wells fargo and also because i can get work done i will work well on a team  but at the end of the day if things arent getting done  i will overcompensate and do it myself so  you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm ,4.95273468811,1,im good ok well im junior mit im currently study computer science biology new joint major minor management thats little bit background um last summer work well fargo bank san francisco principal invest group invest lot long term security like buy side trading ok freshman year um project call six four seventy iep like competition youre suppose get team design website like first time u kind program well little background much um basically end day come get team together everyone thing iep everyone try fun also like guy deadline need get b basically stepped leadership roll bring team together manage finish project pas class didnt win u award least finished guess kind relate previous example talk depth guess um guess main issue get back end database work correctly um none u ever program like mysql language know um basically tried delegate task make one friend set uh get hub server another friend say ok try focus like match algorithm ill try put thing together create like front end website bring code together yeah team experience think one weaknesses um work team sometimes try much um like sometimes like people say oh help previously show inconsistency past ill try get do really like delegate thing yeah thats something need work think uh overcome try good leader um actually go leadership uh program right call cclp thats help lot leadership skill think hire necessary background experience um past summer uh well fargo also get work do work well team end day thing arent get do overcompensate count meet deadline necessary firm
p37,huh  pretty well  how are you um i am a junior in course 18 which is applied math uh  obviously i go to mit  uhm whoops sorry im also probably going to major in management science uhm  as well as im really interested in minoring in economics um outsie of academics i do a lot of sports  i play water polo  i rock clmb a lot  uhm i run and bike a lot and uh im involved in lots of random clubs at mit so i like to keep busy  uhm well ive been swimming  well i was a varsity swimmer in hs as well as college   uhm  so i swam competitively for 15 years uhm  so i was the captain of my high school as well as my summer club swim team uhm  leadership wise i guess the summer swim team was where i felt like i had  had the most influential leadership position uhm   just because i was on the same team for 14 years uhm and so i really got to develop my relationships with all of the younger swimmers  uhm  even before i was in an official captain position oh  um  so i did a lot of uh  uh  coaching of younger kids  uhm  a lot of team management as in like setting up events  setting up meets  heping meets and everything running smoothly  uhm  as well as just leading   you know  cheers  helping people stay focus and stay organized at practices  hm well i was on the financial metrics team  in my internship last summer which was basically just the quantitative analysis team uhm  and so we had a problem in one of our like  quantitative analysis programs that was running and non one really knew where it was coming from so as a team we uh  like divide and conquer  broke down uh individual sections of the program to look at and uh  correlated those with each persons expertise  so i analyzed mainly the r portion whereas um  my teammate  my coworker and lets me lead my sequel portion of the code and broke it up that way  i guess  yeah  eventually with help from the uh  finance expert uhm  hm i would say one of my weaknesses is that i dont always push myself hard enough  uhm as far as academically i like to be challenged but i dont always seek those out um  so to overcome that i have done a lot of searching through the mit coursework to  uhm  find classes that look interesting as well as challenging and to sign up for a lot of classes that are outside just the minimum major requirements so that i could get a bit more of a challenge instead of just doing the bare minimum  uhm  because im a very fast learner um  im dedicated and i know how to work hard  because its something that ive done for my entire life and  uh  i like being busy and i like working hard  so if im given a task ill work hard until its done well ,4.87347827118,1,huh pretty well um junior course apply math uh obviously go mit whoop sorry im also probably go major management science well im really interested minoring economics um outsie academic lot sport play water polo rock clmb lot run bike lot uh im involve lot random clubs mit like keep busy well ive swim well varsity swimmer h well college swam competitively year captain high school well summer club swim team leadership wise guess summer swim team felt like influential leadership position team year really get develop relationship young swimmer even official captain position oh um lot uh uh coaching young kid lot team management like set event set meet heping meet everything run smoothly well lead know cheer help people stay focus stay organize practice hm well financial metric team internship last summer basically quantitative analysis team problem one like quantitative analysis program run non one really know come team uh like divide conquer break uh individual section program look uh correlate person expertise analyze mainly r portion whereas um teammate coworker let lead sequel portion code break way guess yeah eventually help uh finance expert hm would say one weaknesses dont always push hard enough far academically like challenge dont always seek um overcome do lot search mit coursework find class look interest well challenge sign lot class outside minimum major requirement could get bit challenge instead bare minimum im fast learner um im dedicate know work hard something ive do entire life uh like busy like work hard im give task ill work hard do well
p4,pretty good uhh  so im a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at mit  umm  so right now im currently in the middle of my junior year im looking for a summer internship company and uhh ok umm  so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a g uhh sorry a jet engine for ge  umm i had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine uhh that we would have to present at uhh something to present to ge engineers umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasnt really able to do much and uhh another person ended up uhh sh wasnt showing up very much so during that time i sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who werent sick uhh and basically help them communicate  talk to each other  and set up meetings uhh  i sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project umm uhh umm so over the summer i was working at at auburn university um i was doing uhh uav collision avoidance algorithms so like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of uavs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other umm i was working with a partner  but in a larger context of umm a dozen students umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming ai sort of aeronautics umm sort of project  uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of uav design umm so that became a bit of an issue  umm but umm i think basically what ended up happening was i worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up  up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for uav and umm in that case i drew upon a lot of resources that were available there umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us  the professor who was in charge of the ex uhh the project as well as with other students in the program ummm  so i think one of my weaknesses is that umm i have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late umm this is actually probably after im used to after im used to going to a certain place umm because i have a tendency to think that  and especially in the mornings because i have a tendency to think oh i can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed so  i think uhh what i tend to do uhh what im trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where i need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time its something that ive tried to implement over the past couple weeks umm i think you should hire me  because umm basically ive demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience  a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that i think i would be an asset to your company umm i think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh i have a good balance that would be useful to you ,4.68837924196,0,pretty good im junior study aeronautics astronautics mit right im currently middle junior year im look summer internship company ok example last year work class project try design g sorry jet engine ge work group people try optimize certain certain parameter engine would present something present ge engineer time one team member actually get really sick actually go medical couple day wasnt really able much another person end sh wasnt show much time sort basically facilitate people werent sick basically help communicate talk set meeting sort take helm towards towards end lot basically get everybody together complete project summer work auburn university um uav collision avoidance algorithm like program thing allow allow whole bunch uavs fly airspace basically get directive without crash work partner large context dozen student turn challenge case although sort like program ai sort aeronautics sort project partner come chemical engineering background really programming experience experience sort uav design become bit issue think basically end happen worked grad student like people basically bring speed basically sort teach program ground level might able help program like uav case draw upon lot resource available know grad student help help u professor charge ex project well student program ummm think one weaknesses tendency show thing kind thing kind late actually probably im use im use go certain place tendency think especially morning tendency think oh get certain place bike certain speed think tend im try nowadays try overcome basically get somewhere hand basically work oppose try work away place need like sort try make nick time something ive tried implement past couple week think hire basically ive demonstrate past couple year fair amount research experience fair amount experience classroom sort academic setting research development set think would asset company think past experience software hardwares aeronautics make good balance would useful
p42,um  so im a junior at mit im in aerospace engineering um  im thinking of doing more of the  the aeronautics side rather than the astronautics side  although i dont have to decide until later um  im in rotc and  you know  in the air force portion im hoping to become a pilot uh  i applied pretty recently and ill find out maybe in february or march of next year um  im also in sigma alpha epsilon fraternity our house is on the east campus across the river and ive been living there since i was a sophomore um  thats  thats basically me um  so  probably the biggest chance i got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when i went to pretty much rotcs version of boot camp its called field training and its about a month long and its in alabama and its pretty much a test to see what youd do in really stressful situations so  uh  theyd give us pretty big things like wed have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and wed have to make sure they got to this place at the right time and then do um  i guess the correct action when we get there and make sure nobodys going astray or making sure that like all the obstacles the instructors set up  uh  we can overcome them so  being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably um  the most challenging leadership experience ive ever had um  hm  to give i guess a nonrotcrelated example  um  as we have a decent amount of projects in um  core 16 like unified is  a lot  is very project based in the second semester and  um  one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that um  i guess  the work was being allocated so at first  it was supposed to be um  very evenly divided so each person on the fourperson team would do a quarter of the work but  um  some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more and by the middle of the semester  it was very unequal and so  it was kind of getting  you know  under everyones skin so  as a group  after we um  we realized that it just wouldnt  it was really a detriment to our productivity  we all had a group meeting and said  listen  this is what we have to do we have to reallocate the certain things that are um  are the parts of the project that um  we had  we wanted to originally and um  it just kind of went astray so  we did that  and we became a lot better um  working on a team  faced with a challenge um  hm i can think of um  try to not um  hit the same categories so um  in sae  in the fraternity that im in  last semester i was the recruitment chair so  the  the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan rush like  plan our events for cpw  plan our events for fall rush  plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year  or for a full school year  excuse me um  and  the question was challenges in a group  right okay so  challenges and teamwork so  rush is very teamoriented because youre trying to work with your brothers to um  really see i guess  which freshmen uh  are the most compatible with your fraternity and that youd probably have the best time with so  the way i set it up was we actually did work in small teams of about 4 or 5 brothers and wed go out and you know  do fun things and meet freshmen i would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others and the team that i was in  uh  was a little bit less active and  of course as being rush chair  i didnt want that to be the case i wanted to change that so  um  especially in situations where you dont have um  you dont have like hard  given  not given  but like outlined powers like youre not someones boss youre just like another brother in the fraternity um  the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation so thats what i ended up using a lot to get for a while as rush chair to get people to go out so it was all  always being like very excited to do it and like knowing that youre passionate about it and telling them  or and like having them realize that oh  this is a really good thing that we should be doing and it will really help us out and it will be fun so thats how i solved that problem so  my greatest weakness i normally would probably have to think a lot more about but  i actually had a similar conversation with um one of my bosses in rotc about a month and a half ago so  i would say my greatest weakness is when i get put in really stressful situations  i will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and wont necessarily think about  or  i think through the whole process um  like to fruition ill kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so  um  so the situation can be like  i guess resolved so what im working on is just being able to like even in a stressful situation and i know it is a problem to kind of slow down and take a step back and really like at things kind of from a higher altitude  um  im a really hard worker i absolutely will devote myself to um  this company i  i think as a team member  im very cooperative uh  if the goal we have as a team  if i agree with it  and for the most part i will and if i wont then ill voice  and like ill voice my concerns and try to make it something everyone can agree on and if i agree on it  um  then i am or ill definitely be able to participate in the team in a very productive manner ill be a very good follower and if  um  if its needed i can be a very good leader as well all right ,3.83849946468,0,um im junior mit im aerospace engineering um im think aeronautics side rather astronautics side although dont decide later um im rotc know air force portion im hop become pilot uh apply pretty recently ill find maybe february march next year um im also sigma alpha epsilon fraternity house east campus across river ive living since sophomore um thats thats basically um probably big chance get demonstrate leadership far life past summer go pretty much rotc version boot camp call field train month long alabama pretty much test see youd really stressful situation uh theyd give u pretty big thing like wed charge people wed make sure get place right time um guess correct action get make sure nobody go astray make sure like obstacle instructor set uh overcome charge people good two three day everything high stress probably um challenge leadership experience ive ever um hm give guess nonrotcrelated example um decent amount project um core like unified lot project base second semester um one big problem specific group way um guess work allocate first suppose um evenly divide person fourperson team would quarter work um people start little bit less people start little bit middle semester unequal kind get know everyones skin group um realize wouldnt really detriment productivity group meeting say listen reallocate certain thing um part project um want originally um kind go astray become lot good um work team face challenge um hm think um try um hit category um sae fraternity im last semester recruitment chair job recruitment chair essentially plan rush like plan event cpw plan event fall rush plan event spring rush full calendar year full school year excuse um question challenge group right okay challenge teamwork rush teamoriented youre try work brother um really see guess freshman uh compatible fraternity youd probably best time way set actually work small team brother wed go know fun thing meet freshman would say big problem rush team lot active others team uh little bit less active course rush chair didnt want case want change um especially situation dont um dont like hard give give like outlined power like youre someone bos youre like another brother fraternity um best kind way convince people something want positive motivation thats end use lot get rush chair get people go always like excite like know youre passionate tell like realize oh really good thing really help u fun thats solve problem great weakness normally would probably think lot actually similar conversation um one boss rotc month half ago would say great weakness get put really stressful situation tend jump decision conclusion quickly wont necessarily think think whole process um like fruition ill kind like hurry want get something um situation like guess resolve im work able like even stressful situation know problem kind slow take step back really like thing kind high altitude um im really hard worker absolutely devote um company think team member im cooperative uh goal team agree part wont ill voice like ill voice concern try make something everyone agree agree um ill definitely able participate team productive manner ill good follower um need good leader well right
p43,sure  so im a senior at mit in management and computer science uhm  im really interested in the intersection of the two so  you know  not just  uhm  you know  how computers can  you know  you know  how  like the best algorithms to do about computers like you know inventing the next algorithm  the next compression algorithm  not really something that im interested in doing but uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses  sure  so  uhm  i guess id say earlier this year so im actually the president of baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in mit we had this process called rex residence exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow  you know  recruit or retain the freshmen that they have uhm  and  the rex event that we had uh  we threw a bunch of events  had about ten workers that we had  were able to give early arrival to so free housing uh  so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over sevenhundred people attend  sure so i think theres  you know  always been challenges so last summer when i was at disney  uhm  there were  there was some disagreement about uh  how we should  when we should schedule  the  uh  what week we should schedule the  uh  trial for uhm  and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm  uh  dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then wed have to have the app also consider time zone issues so basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that  you know  by changing this date  pushing it back  were adding scope to the app and were going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back  yep sure so i think the  the problem  uhm  that i have the most is  uh  in delegating task to people so  uhm  i want to make sure that things are done properly so i tend to overly control on things so basically ive been thinking to myself alright is this something core that i really have to do no i think lets you know  lets get someone else to do it  and that way also they also they learn it so  you know  when i graduate theyre able to take on that role  sure sure i think uhm  i combine  you know  technical expertise with uh  business expertise and product expertise so  hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app i think is  uh  would be optimal because i have expertise in all these areas and ive worked in all these areas in the past  uhm  and im able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that i think few other candidates  uhm  have  thank you for having me ,5.56130636558,1,sure im senior mit management computer science im really interested intersection two know know computer know know like best algorithms computer like know invent next algorithm next compression algorithm really something im interested uh really find computer help apply people life make new business improve exist business sure guess id say early year im actually president baker house earlier begin year mit process call rex residence exploration dorm try throw event somehow know recruit retain freshman rex event uh throw bunch event ten worker able give early arrival free housing uh run five six event large party sevenhundred people attend sure think there know always challenge last summer disney disagreement uh schedule uh week schedule uh trial disagreement whether later uh date program would ready pass certain date wed app also consider time zone issue basically discuss stake holder let know know change date push back add scope app go make additional development change see would able flexible change back yep sure think problem uh delegate task people want make sure thing do properly tend overly control thing basically ive think alright something core really think let know let get someone else way also also learn know graduate theyre able take role sure sure think combine know technical expertise uh business expertise product expertise hire product manager mobile app think uh would optimal expertise area ive work area past im able bring expertise organization way think candidate thank
p44,okay  um  my names evan  evan muray  im a junior here at mit in computer science im originally from louisville kentucky and  uh  yeah i currently live across the river i heard about this study through email so  thought id check it out you did nice a leader uh sure um a good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work  activities  so im involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills one is camp kesem mit which is a student organization here on campus at mit uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children whos parents have or have had cancer um  and i serve on the coordinator board for this organization um  in the past i was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers whod would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year  send them newsletters  send them updates  plan reunions for them uh this year i am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and inaudible with students  so i work as a coordinator i actually have a cocoordinator  we usually work in tandem the other activity is dance troop its another student organization here at mit  where we put on a show each year and dance  have some fun  its a dance show  and im a choreography for that organization as well i lead a dance  teach people some dance moves for some fun thanks sure  uh  i think a great example of that would be this past january  i participated in a web design competition here on campus  6470  i was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours its always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them there was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go we had different visions for how we wanted it to look  and i think for me the best way that i handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because i think its a very important skill and also just listening  active listening i was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website and by doing that  um  i was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards  i think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that i definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but  i mean  we needed to get through it my greatest weakness hm okay uh id say my  one of my bigger weaknesses is  uh  id say  probably uh  selfstarting  actually its something ive been working  its like my goal for this year  to work on in the past i would do my classes  take my classes  and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes if theres one thing i learned from being around all these amazing people here at mit  is if you have an idea just go for it its very easy  especially here  theres resources to do so  and  its something that i want to work on  i have some ideas for projects i want to start on my own its always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects but  this  i plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that  and hopefully i will gain some more experience in computer sciences uh  i think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly  coming to mit for example  i came to mit with very little experience in the field computer science many of my past internships  ive been going to  i dont have much experience  but i pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems i find that  uh  after doing some examples of a certain problem  or just playing around with it for a little bit  i can get to work on using that sort of technology in the past couple internships  ive had to deal with new languages  new framework  and i think that definitely more then compensates for any experience im lacking no problem  thank you for having me ,4.38128014733,0,okay um name evan evan muray im junior mit computer science im originally louisville kentucky uh yeah currently live across river heard study email think id check nice leader uh sure um good example would uh extra curricular work activity im involve uh two activity general showcase leadership skills one camp kesem mit student organization campus mit uh summer organization put summer camp child whos parent cancer um serve coordinator board organization um past charge handle application contact family camper whod would come camp contact throughout year send newsletter send update plan reunion uh year charge ask student campus get student apply become counselor camp inaudible student work coordinator actually cocoordinator usually work tandem activity dance troop another student organization mit put show year dance fun dance show im choreography organization well lead dance teach people dance move fun thanks sure uh think great example would past january participate web design competition campus team girlfriend mutual friend always different work group friend oppose hang bit conflict want website go different vision want look think best way handle sort willing compromise think important skill also listen active listen listening want make certain change website um able uh figure uh sort like common ground could work towards think eventually hit um able move forward one conflict definitely remember pretty big time mean need get great weakness hm okay uh id say one big weaknesses uh id say probably uh selfstarting actually something ive work like goal year work past would class take class really kind schoolwork significantly outside class theres one thing learn around amazing people mit idea go easy especially there resource something want work idea project want start always issue actually start thing come idea really get start certain project plan start website idea hopefully gain experience computer science uh think one best quality ability really quickly come mit example come mit little experience field computer science many past internship ive go dont much experience pride sort grasp idea quickly uh build top use build solution problem find uh example certain problem play around little bit get work use sort technology past couple internship ive deal new language new framework think definitely compensate experience im lack problem thank
p45,pretty good  how are you so uh my names bonnie im a junior at mit im in core six which if you dont know is in computer science im minoring in economics umm also mathematics so im interested in you know application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of like interesting fields so  that includes like economics  finance  biology so a vary wide array of interests and im here today because well i was uh  told it would be a good time here with the behavior study oh what year were you okay okay  so id say one fairly informal instance actually was over this last spring break a couple friends and i  four of us actually  so a fairly small group  um  we biked from philadelphia to boston over spring break because we thought that would be a good idea what it actually was  huh  there were some amazing ups  some amazing downs umm  definitely a very memorable experience and there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was 45 degrees except your biking on the state highways  its raining  and like  so we felt like giving up a little bit  just heading back up  taking the train and i really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this and reminding us of the fact that we were already 60 of the way through we might as well push on all the way to the end of our journey just like i guess evoking everyones different motivation because everyone you know wants to do something awesome  but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they join a team in the first place and i guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to uh you know different parts of our team as to why they came on in the first place and why thats still something that resonates with them and using that you know i was able to get the group back together and we did bike all the way back up here so that was a very rewarding experience sorry  a what challenge oh  oh  another challenge  okay um  well lets see  most of the challenges ive seen coming in any sort of team work right involve either internal challenges  something thats coming from within the team  or an external challenge so i guess if we were to talk about an external challenge  umm  something not involving you know lack of motivation  uhh  it would  uh  lets see so uh  so my  my freshman year i was involved  uh  i was involved in this organization called tech fair where we basically organized a um a tech expo at the beginning of the uh  beginning of the school year and i was  again i was  i was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening  a lot of twelvehour days to get the logistics down before the event and i guess again there it uh it does come down to really motivating people  um and speaking to their individual you know passions to get them to you know do things which they might not want to and short cut um  my greatest weakness ive noticed can be a uh lack of  lack of focus especially if i have like a large number of tasks  its very easy to instead of you know caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time its very easy for me to you know pop one but still have you know like subtasks and the other things i have to do running in my mind um  so of late  ive been trying to basically get more organized ive you know had this hypothesis that by using a google calendar  google this  google that  all these other products to try you know serve as fairly intelligent places where i can hash away my uh  my other tasks it will provide me with something which is very trustworthy that i will trust enough to not what worry about those tasks because what usually happens  right  i just write it down on a piece of paper um i dont trust that ill be able to find and the risk of forgetting to do something important is  is pretty great to bear so that  thats been pretty useful so far ive noticed that ive had an urge sometimes to think about other things i have to do  but i just remind myself that wait wait you wrote that down there you probably knew what you were doing  so dont worry about that theres a supervisor which is yourself taking care of your other tasks so i think that one thing um i do retain in addition to well like  like i said ive had what used to be a problem in terms of being able to focus on a task but it does come with the added benefit of being able to juggle lots of tasks at the same time i know lots of people who do focus on one task  it often becomes one task  one project going on for you know a couple months uh becomes the forefront of their thought  their imagination  becomes what they can handle however  having been accustomed to juggling lots of stuff in the past  i think one great skill i can bring to the table is umm provide a very  very agile agile member to the team who can juggle lots of different projects and bring insight to all of them without  with my newfound organizational abilities  getting too uhh too caught up in the mix thank you very much for uhh talking to me ,5.16626547469,1,pretty good uh name bonnie im junior mit im core six dont know computer science im minoring economics also mathematics im interested know application data quantitative reason sort like interest field include like economics finance biology vary wide array interest im today well uh tell would good time behavior study oh year okay okay id say one fairly informal instance actually last spring break couple friend four u actually fairly small group um bike philadelphia boston spring break think would good idea actually huh amaze ups amazing down definitely memorable experience point course trip degree except bike state highway rain like felt like give little bit head back take train really riled people term remind u remind u fact already way might well push way end journey like guess evoke everyones different motivation everyone know want something awesome everyone slightly different motivation join team first place guess provide like individualized reason individualize motivation uh know different part team come first place thats still something resonate use know able get group back together bike way back reward experience sorry challenge oh oh another challenge okay um well let see challenge ive see come sort team work right involve either internal challenge something thats come within team external challenge guess talk external challenge something involve know lack motivation would uh let see uh freshman year involve uh involved organization call tech fair basically organize um tech expo begin uh begin school year able motivate people towards end lot work happen lot twelvehour day get logistics event guess uh come really motivate people um speak individual know passion get know thing might want short cut um great weakness ive notice uh lack lack focus especially like large number task easy instead know cache away task somewhere focus one time easy know pop one still know like subtasks thing run mind um late ive try basically get organize ive know hypothesis use google calendar google google product try know serve fairly intelligent place hash away uh task provide something trustworthy trust enough worry task usually happen right write piece paper um dont trust ill able find risk forget something important pretty great bear thats pretty useful far ive noticed ive urge sometimes think thing remind wait wait write probably knew dont worry theres supervisor take care task think one thing um retain addition well like like say ive use problem term able focus task come add benefit able juggle lot tasks time know lot people focus one task often become one task one project go know couple month uh becomes forefront thought imagination become handle however accustomed juggle lot stuff past think one great skill bring table provide agile agile member team juggle lot different project bring insight without newfound organizational ability get caught mix thank much talk
p47,good  how are you doing uhh  so my name is skylar shieto  im a junior currently here at mit im studying course 18 mathematics  uhmm  currently enjoying it alot  uhmm  classes im currently taking not so much uhmm  i dont know  is there anything in particular you want to know ok  ok uhmm  ok  so i was over at ip i did book reports uhmm  i kind of assumed like a project mangerish role  particularly because i wasnt really familiar with python too much  which is the coding language that they used to test uhmm  so i assumed more of a director kind of doing the math for it and kind of instructing people to do the mathematical thinking for that kind of thing uhmm  let me see  i usually take this particular example one of the tough things is you having to explain things that are sort of  something that is very familiar to you to someone who doesnt have familiarity with that and  especially in a really short time uhh  can be extremely difficult uhmm  its how to deal with that uhh  sort of just by giving a crash course  uhm  kind of asking other friends to also help  so its uhmm  kind of give some information and ask for feedback  that sort of thing ok  uhh  lets see  one of my weaknesses uhhm  technical writing  uhmm  and what im doing to overcome that actually not very much  im taking a math writing class uh  so thats been really helpful its in a subject that i really enjoy   and i actually have a paper due this friday so hopefully i show so improvement and that would help uhmm  not particularly sorry uhmm  soo  i would like a job which is sort of very open  uhmm  sort of open in a sense that its open to new ideas  open to uhmm  the ability to uh  work on different stuff sort of like whatever you want uhm  also  in like a sense that you can go in and wear whatever you want you dont have to wear a suit and tie everyday  uhm  yeah uh  wouldnt be too bad laughs i think this is also the sort of place where i can do things that are in my interest  uhmm  like statistics or computer sciencethose sort of things ,3.41600800958,0,good name skylar shieto im junior currently mit im study course mathematics uhmm currently enjoy alot uhmm class im currently take much uhmm dont know anything particular want know ok ok uhmm ok ip book report uhmm kind assume like project mangerish role particularly wasnt really familiar python much coding language use test uhmm assume director kind math kind instruct people mathematical think kind thing uhmm let see usually take particular example one tough thing explain thing sort something familiar someone doesnt familiarity especially really short time extremely difficult uhmm deal sort give crash course kind ask friend also help uhmm kind give information ask feedback sort thing ok let see one weaknesses uhhm technical write uhmm im overcome actually much im take math write class uh thats really helpful subject really enjoy actually paper due friday hopefully show improvement would help uhmm particularly sorry uhmm soo would like job sort open uhmm sort open sense open new idea open uhmm ability uh work different stuff sort like whatever want also like sense go wear whatever want dont wear suit tie everyday yeah uh wouldnt bad laugh think also sort place thing interest uhmm like statistic computer sciencethose sort thing
p48, im doing well  uh  im a student  i study computer science  uh  im in my last year so when i graduate in may im going to be working on computer science stuff  i demonstrate leadership on the track team  i was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh  seniors on the team myself included uh   lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able toto stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that  hm in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didnt have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group  so the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out  so that was pretty rough  but this happened like a year ago  so like one of my close friends was like i cant afford these prices  like theres just no way and like then it dominoes  which was a huge problem    and a lot of people suggested a lot of differenta lot of different solutions  most of them were like motivated from anger  so uh  some people were like everybody who moves out should have to pay and other people were like oh no if im if not living there i shouldnt have to do anything so  so it was like pretty contentious  but  but we worked it out to a it was like a variation of a plan that i suggested which was that we would uh  we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room  so wed allow people to have more space themselves and pay more  but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh  could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money  so  so we kept some of the people we kicked out  yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed  uh  im the opposite of type a so i can be pretty disorganized  my lab notebooks like a lot of the time i make a lot of scribbles in at and when i write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side  um  so  so  it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing   i never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that ive been on that i had to leave  uh  the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where i left off and had no idea what was going on and i was like this is actually a problem the teachers like dont just tell you to document just to aggravate you  so  i worked uh  so like since then like ive been working on like documenting what i do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it  so that like theres some kind of like review before like i show other people or before i let it out to a point that other people might rely on it  so just to like read my documentation that and which ive never done before until this most recent project had that problem  yeah  sure  yeah  mostly because uh  results  im  i just like get things done  and theres a like  theres a lot of things i know how to do  especially the job im thinking of is like a programming job like a startup  my background  my degree is actually nuclear engineering  so  so like i dont have like the background the internships the stuff like that  a lot of the coding interview questions they tend to ask i dont know  which is pretty rough  but uh i  i think that i would be  i should be hired because i would be resourceful and id do what it takes to get things done which is like working longer  being more resourceful  and stuff like that  so like  i   i feel like i could get more results then somebody who has the same  or somebody who has a better background ,4.14381035699,0,im well uh im student study computer science uh im last year graduate may im go work computer science stuff demonstrate leadership track team senior pole vaulter team uh right uh condition stuff like preseason lot freshman come important get speed uh senior team include uh lead though workouts stuff like important able toto stand let know tradition stuff like hm live group uh problem rent get expensive didnt quite enough people live still set amount rent pay group price go point people get kick pretty rough happen like year ago like one close friend like cant afford price like there way like domino huge problem lot people suggest lot differenta lot different solution like motivate anger uh people like everybody move pay people like oh im live shouldnt anything like pretty contentious work like variation plan suggest would uh would change rent base room size many people live room wed allow people space pay people would otherwise force could uh could people cram room save lot money keep people kick yeah pretty rough get motion pass uh im opposite type pretty disorganized lab notebook like lot time make lot scribble write code documentation like tends shaky side um make kinda hard people follow never really think problem though recent project ive leave uh project short amount time partner like picked leave idea go like actually problem teacher like dont tell document aggravate work uh like since like ive work like document like diligently also check back like there kind like review like show people let point people might rely like read documentation ive never do recent project problem yeah sure yeah mostly uh result im like get thing do there like there lot thing know especially job im think like program job like startup background degree actually nuclear engineering like dont like background internship stuff like lot cod interview question tend ask dont know pretty rough uh think would hire would resourceful id take get thing do like work longer resourceful stuff like like feel like could get result somebody somebody well background
p49,so my name is fernando iber  i am a junior here  i come from puerto rico  and i am currently studying biological engineering uh  im considering doing premedicine  maybe going into either an md  and  lets say  apply to some schools as an md  or go into an mdphd program um  my main interest is basically oncology  but  like  i  over the past few years im doing a couple of research programs  i did an internship  and it basically  like  gave me a view that i could tackle that problem in a lot of ways so not just being a clinician  but being a researcher  a medical researcher so thats how i got interested into the whole mdphd thing  and  like  ive gotten a hold of some programs that i viewed  and theres a lot out there i couldnt have imagined that if i stayed home its amazing what people do here  so im  im pretty involved in  in campus groups uh  i was the first founder of  of their restructuring of beta theta pi  so im currently  you would say  chapter president uh  so im leading the whole  the whole cavalry of recruitment right here on campus  and were getting a lot of results um  im also in the board of puerto rican students  i serve as social chair  and i am also pretty involved in dorm government  especially reccbw planning  so i just like to get around so any  anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore  any guise is all pretty good for me uh  i was also considering something for soccer  uh  in terms of being team treasurer  but unfortunately i had a bit of an accident with my leg  so i got out of soccer  so  i actually have a really humbling experience last semester i took a class about mechanics a lot of people in that class were juniors and i was a sophomore so everybody there was much more experienced than me  so i was the only sophomore in my group  there were two ones that were juniors  and it was the final project and when we sat down and started talking about things to do  i basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning  cause they already took cell biology  and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics  and they were trying to do some tissue modeling like  even though it was a class about mechanics  and i could understand some of the things  i had absolutely no idea what i was doing and they just put me there  and one of them was really helpful  and actually guided me through the initial process  but the other one was not available at all  at any time so i basically had to sit down  i actually met with the professor a couple of times  just to  like  talk and chat  and we took the professor out for  for a lunch  so we could just  like  talk about stuff  and i actually had to find out my own way through everything  with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me and it was humbling because normally when i worked on teams  we were all pretty equal  equal minded  or it was in a humanities class cause normally technical classes here dont have much to do with team projects in sophomore year normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students  so it was a surprise for me where it came  like  im a sophomore  and im already doing final presentations for biomechanics and it just caught me pretty off guard and the only waywe ended up doing an extremely awesome project  but it took lots of coffee  red bull  and wikipedia thats my strategy for now  cause it was completely new territory right there  compared to humanities or any other classes where youre  everybody has the same mindset so that was my group trauma  so i didnt have any actually trouble selfrecognizing trouble about  so stemming off of  from the inexperience type of situation  that was actually the first group project i had where that experience happened  and i feel like if i get into something that i dont  basically  know  i have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself so if i dont come prepared to do something  it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing  which is kind of a handicap  because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me and i  i  i obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter  but its hard for me so ive been trying  so basically  like  the solution for me was basically studying more  putting much more effort from my part  but its still a big  a big minus in my  in my turf its  uh  it takes me a while to dominate things that  that i dont have an uptospeed inclination to that and that has caused  like  mishaps that  well  through hard work you can overcome them  but a lot of work  compared to your regular person  yeah so i feel like  even though ive gone through many obstacles  ive always tried and found a way to excel  exert myself to bigger than id previously thought so i might sometimes feel that i dont have that knowledge on me  but i will go out and get it  even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort  because theres also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can  but seeing that actually succeed you know what i mean its  uh  its like what mit does to you  youre humbled by an immense amount of work  youre humbled by  by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces  homework  and exams that you are overwhelmed but you sit down  you think about stuff i sit down and i think about stuff  and i get a plan there that  the good thing about the plan  it takes some time to devise a plan  because it  its not as efficient  its not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do  but  but  having  like an educated guess  you remember the sats  where its like you may not always know the answer  but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be so thats how i approach things when i have no idea what im doing  but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where i can say hey  im here  lets get crackin um  thats sort of  like  the general mindset i have for many problems  be it the life sciences  you have to do an essay  if i have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells  or if i go by  the walks of life can take you anywhere  if i end up being a consultant for a  for johnson and johnson  lets say  a company for random purposes  and  its the same way you tackle every problem you get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing  then you sit down and do it uh  sometimes its frustrating  because results dont come out like this  um  but i feel like once you get the hang of it  you can start  your productivity increases by xfold  x be a number  much higher than one  lets talk mit here yeah  i feel thats the  thats at least my way of tackling things and its gotten me through a lot  and its actually helped me wear down the walls of mit and have a better experience at it  so i feel its the same way i should attack all the problems that come to me  ,3.70412090811,0,name fernando iber junior come puerto rico currently study biological engineering uh im consider premedicine maybe go either md let say apply school md go mdphd program um main interest basically oncology like past year im couple research program internship basically like give view could tackle problem lot way clinician researcher medical researcher thats get interested whole mdphd thing like ive gotten hold program view there lot couldnt imagine stayed home amaze people im im pretty involved campus group uh first founder restructuring beta theta pi im currently would say chapter president uh im lead whole whole cavalry recruitment right campus get lot result um im also board puerto rican student serve social chair also pretty involved dorm government especially reccbw plan like get around anything give type opportunity explore guise pretty good uh also consider something soccer uh term team treasurer unfortunately bit accident leg get soccer actually really humble experience last semester take class mechanic lot people class junior sophomore everybody much experience sophomore group two one junior final project sit start talk thing basically almost knowledge thing plan cause already take cell biology take really advanced course fluid dynamic try tissue model like even though class mechanic could understand thing absolutely idea put one really helpful actually guide initial process one available time basically sit actually meet professor couple time like talk chat take professor lunch could like talk stuff actually find way everything little help junior friend actually available humble normally work team pretty equal equal mind humanity class cause normally technical class dont much team project sophomore year normally laboratories final design project class old student surprise come like im sophomore im already final presentation biomechanics catch pretty guard waywe end extremely awesome project take lot coffee red bull wikipedia thats strategy cause completely new territory right compare humanity class youre everybody mindset group trauma didnt actually trouble selfrecognizing trouble stem inexperience type situation actually first group project experience happen feel like get something dont basically know really hard time find stuff dont come prepare something take get pace actually start absorb material actually contribute kind handicap student already speed already expect thing obviously would like give hand everything want silver platter hard ive try basically like solution basically study put much effort part still big big minus turf uh take dominate thing dont uptospeed inclination cause like mishap well hard work overcome lot work compare regular person yeah feel like even though ive go many obstacle ive always try found way excel exert big id previously think might sometimes feel dont knowledge go get even take lot coffee lot effort there also sense satisfaction actually give see actually succeed know mean uh like mit youre humble immense amount work youre humble extremely hard class idea go come blast piece homework exam overwhelm sit think stuff sit think stuff get plan good thing plan take time devise plan efficient efficient go randomly guess like educate guess remember sat like may always know answer make educate guess answer may thats approach thing idea im effort actually get place say hey im let get crackin um thats sort like general mindset many problem life science essay come elucidating mechanism breast cancer cell go walks life take anywhere end consultant johnson johnson let say company random purpose way tackle every problem get find hard time sit uh sometimes frustrating result dont come like um feel like get hang start productivity increase xfold x number much high one let talk mit yeah feel thats thats least way tackle thing get lot actually help wear wall mit good experience feel way attack problem come
p5,myself  um  im a junior majoring in computer science at mit im very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses  i want to pursue  everyone a time when i demonstrated leadership was  um  i was programs chair of the mit minority business association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual new york city trip  and  um  some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially  and by  um  by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people  what was going on in peoples lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time  we were able to have a successful trip um  a time when i was working on a team was in my elemental sulfur construction class and i faced not people problems but a technical problem  and it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didnt deny anyones idea off the bat  we just tried to be as creative as we could be  and then we presented some of our solutions to a ta and through that we were able to solve the technical problem  one of my weaknesses is actually i learned from my internship last summer is that usually when i work on a project or have an idea i wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before i share with others and get their opinion  but its  i find its a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible  so fail fast  essentially  that what i would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when i have an idea working on a project  why i think you should hire me  i think you should hire me because im very  i have a strong willingness to learn and i go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work  i break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success ,5.58251442294,1,um im junior major computer science mit im interested product design product design business side affect user use technology affect mass want pursue everyone time demonstrate leadership um program chair mit minority business association responsibility plan annual new york city trip um challenge bring sponsor delegate tasks member manage people essentially um delegate task accord interest making sure understanding people go people live help understand able complete task time able successful trip um time work team elemental sulfur construction class face people problem technical problem project try implement way solve brainstorm make sure didnt deny anyones idea bat try creative could present solution ta able solve technical problem one weaknesses actually learn internship last summer usually work project idea wait idea fully flesh partially implement share others get opinion find well agile approach share idea soon possible integrate quickly possible fail fast essentially would accomplish future seek opinion early idea work project think hire think hire im strong willingness learn go beyond try really get thing way work break small step try build back similar success
p50,myself umm i dont know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything i am young i am junior right now i am in my third year i am i guess i talk about what i am majoring umm i am majoring in mathematics and physics i am also doubling in core six computer science and umm i think i am getting minor in french and french literature grew up in the states in northern virginia growing up i guess i was interested in i played a lot of competitive chess i was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer and um other forms of umm at high school i was at my junior and senior years i was captain of umm chess team of my high school and umm we participated in something people thinks of chess as an individual sport but umm we participated in quite a few team events through the states which means one every year which we have been winning every year every year umm and also at the nationals and before i went there they were little bit out of leadership they used to get may be fifth or so but when i was there i was umm managed to lead us to almost the first we came in second in three years in a row we came first in blitz which is speed chess under my leadership and to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with but perhaps had they not had that environment wouldnt have done as well challenge umm there are countless examples when umm in group projects in high school umm there was one time when umm freshman year in high school we were working on a umm we had something we called ibet integrated biology electronics and umm biology english technology we had a group project four persons in the group and a few days before the presentation we found the person who had done a decent bit of data analysis had done it incorrectly and he was not available he was out of town at the time again we didnt fully know what had gone wrong but he had come up with some results which were clearly umm could not be explained by experimental error clearly he had done something incorrectly so we had rush to fix what had gone wrong and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given the time constraint we had to redivision the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and compile the final presentation of course its not a life threatening challenge weaknesses umm i guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what i want to do and focusing all my faculty on that rather than keeping ones options open which i think a good thing but i think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks this is important because where i went to high school the culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that and in the end you probably go to pick something i think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically i want to do and devote resources to that umm what i am trying to do to address that it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical but what ive been doing is trying out wide variety of things so i cant use the excuse there are bunch of things i dont know yet ill keep my options open ill try them out and if i dont like them ill drop thats a way to decide whats left to do that id like alright so its still early in terms of job search but one job that i would like that i am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance and umm i think id be a strong candidate because i have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work ive done physics as well and umm i have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports i have always known especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading i have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game and that i think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job ,5.02627199859,1,dont know much know sort registration anything young junior right

p52,fine uh  im daniel im a freshman im from  uh  fort lauderdale  florida thinking about course an61 here i  uh  actually  uh  i was here for running  but i realized it wasnt me  so  um  i decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon so  um  yeah  classes i am doing fine looking for a job now thats about it uh  id say  probably  id say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration i was  um  senior in my  in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with searesing id really  like  thought it showed them that  like  even though i wasnt put in the best situation  like  i performed indiscriminately and  i think  in a way i showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even  like  half the season we were always like around the same time and  we ended up  uh  medaling at states and id say that  um  a good part of that is by leading by example by the older  um  upper classmen  so i feel like maybe that was the point where i was demonstrating leadership well  there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing so um  if it wasnt  i think  um i went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year  and she helped me sort things a lot she showed that i did have  um  proper technique it was more of like  like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better i realized that  um  as long as i kept on pursuing the sport  like  thats all that really mattered thats all  like  my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere  that will help me get into mit so  i feel like  um  this  this like seeing things in my own way  right  and being distraught by other people effecting me helped  i think one of my weaknesses has to be  um  the fact that  im a little  um  delinquent with my work and  uh  um  im lazy at times i definitely procrastinate it was a pursuing thing through high school and  uh  its still a little now because of a passing record one of my combating is goal setting i learned it from one of my  uh  from one of these  one of an upperclassmen that i know in  uh  at mit he  uh  told me  like  to write out  like  weekly goals and write out long term goals like  long terms goals meaning  like  the end of mit  after mit  what you want to do after the mit experience  and short term goals  which is  like  get stuff done now so  in a way that kind of put me things  put things in perspective for me realize that i shouldnt be burning too much time messing around by  i mean  certainly i should be messing around a little bit just because its  its a good time to have fun and relax but  at the same time  i shouldnt do it in excess so  i guess thats helped me a little bit  um  actually  yeah  um ive never had lab experience before  so i really want a role  which is why uh  well  for starters  um  i dont have any experience  so i feel like  um  its a good place for me to start and im really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it um  i see how  um  im not taking too many classes this semester cuz im a course advantage ill be making sure ill have enough time to make classes  uh  more manageable i should be able to commit hours on it im really interested in the job im doing  so  hopefully that interest will inspire me  uh  inspire me to work hard ,4.32473587626,0,fine uh im daniel im freshman im uh fort lauderdale florida think course uh actually uh run realize wasnt um decide drop early pursue travelon um yeah class fine look job thats uh id say probably id say row high school probably best demonstration um senior junior varsity boat little qualms sear id really like thought show like even though wasnt put best situation like perform indiscriminately think way show would still able compete varsity eight time like always even like half season always like around time end uh medaling state id say um good part lead example old um upper classmen feel like maybe point demonstrate leadership well lot issue coach row um wasnt think um go lot issue like assistant coach come year help sort thing lot show um proper technique like like discriminate issue coach want certain people boat think would move well realize um long keep pursue sport like thats really matter thats like effort fruit something take somewhere help get mit feel like um like see thing way right distraught people effect help think one weaknesses um fact im little um delinquent work uh um im lazy time definitely procrastinate pursue thing high school uh still little passing record one combating goal set learn one uh one one upperclassmen know uh mit uh tell like write like weekly goal write long term goal like long term goal mean like end mit mit want mit experience short term goal like get stuff do way kind put thing put thing perspective realize shouldnt burn much time mess around mean certainly mess around little bit good time fun relax time shouldnt excess guess thats help little bit um actually yeah um ive never lab experience really want role uh well starter um dont experience feel like um good place start im really willing whatever take make time um see um im take many class semester cuz im course advantage ill make sure ill enough time make class uh manageable able commit hour im really interested job im hopefully interest inspire uh inspire work hard
p53,um  well  i was born in nigeria  um  and i moved to the united states at the age of eight  um and lived here  um  in boston actually ever since  um  and um  for as long as i remember umm ive always wanted to go into the medical field umm ive always wanted to be a doctor  and just recently actually discovered that i wanted to be a pediatrician umm after working with kids and doing a lot of babysitting in high school and have actually umm shadowed a neonatologist and i feel like that was when it clicked that i actually really want to be a pediatrician  umm and ive tutored a lot  umm middle school and high school  and thats really like affirmed the fact that i do like my career  i want it to be something where i work with kids a time ive demonstrated leadership umm i guess one obvious one is the student groups that i work with umm my primary umm student group is the black students union im currently a coach here umm and ive been active with the group since ive been at mit umm currently as a coach here i plan all events for umm the group umm as well as kind of represent the group umm in front of administration as far as like what our members want  what they need  umm if they have any concerns or anything like that and we have several meetings with administration on a regular basis just to communicate whats going on  what were doing  and what our membership needs and what how they can help us with that teamfaced a challenge umm okay  umm i guess back to the student group umm so this is the second time ive actually been on the executive board umm the first  umm  last year the executive board ran really smoothly we worked well together but this year wewere kind of having problems cause its a new set of people so its kind of hard adjusting umm to the people im working with umm so you know  we all have different viewpoints  different ways of approaching things umm  so we had a lot of loss of communication  which kind of hindered umm our uh progress this year umm but in the past few weeks weve been able to kind of figure out that  you know  theres been a loss of communication  and we should definitely  like  you know  we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get the things that we want accomplished done my weaknessesumm i think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no im the kind of person that  if someone asks me to do something even if i feel like its impossible i always say yes umm and ive alwaysi think i realized that problem when i came at mit and ive been working on that ever since my sophomore year umm and im a junior right now umm and what ive been doing to overcome it is kind of schedule myself umm i have my calendar i live by my calendar  and i know if it doesnt fit on my calendar  if its overlapping with something  then absolutely no  i cant do it so i live by my calendar now and its definitely helping me say no to things when people ask me to do things for them laughs umm i think that i am a good asset umm  one  because mit experience has definitely prepared me for  i would say  the worst  umm because of the experience as an mit student so  its a unique experience  umm but ive also umm gained a lot of umm a broad range of academic skills  umm not just in  in the life sciences but also in engineering field and political science field umm that i think i can bring into the medical field umm with the help of the knowledge that i gain in medical school to kind of help the world  which is want i want to do  ultimately so i think umm i would be a good asset for the medical field ,4.71024567086,0,um well born nigeria um move united state age eight um live um boston actually ever since um um long remember ive always want go medical field ive always want doctor recently actually discover wanted pediatrician work kid lot babysitting high school actually shadow neonatologist feel like click actually really want pediatrician ive tutor lot middle school high school thats really like affirm fact like career want something work kid time ive demonstrated leadership guess one obvious one student group work primary student group black student union im currently coach ive active group since ive mit currently coach plan event group well kind represent group front administration far like member want need concern anything like several meeting administration regular basis communicate whats go membership need help u teamfaced challenge okay guess back student group second time ive actually executive board first last year executive board run really smoothly work well together year wewere kind problem cause new set people kind hard adjusting people im work know different viewpoint different way approach thing lot loss communication kind hinder uh progress year past week weve able kind figure know theres loss communication definitely like know need figure stop barrier learn communicate order get thing want accomplish do weaknessesumm think big weakness know say im kind person someone ask something even feel like impossible always say yes ive alwaysi think realize problem come mit ive work ever since sophomore year im junior right ive overcome kind schedule calendar live calendar know doesnt fit calendar overlap something absolutely cant live calendar definitely help say thing people ask thing laugh think good asset one mit experience definitely prepared would say bad experience mit student unique experience ive also gain lot broad range academic skill life science also engineering field political science field think bring medical field help knowledge gain medical school kind help world want want ultimately think would good asset medical field
p55,umm so im a junior at mit  im a math major  umm i have experience in both the economic side of things and uhh cs  simple coding   umm interested in going into probably analytics or trading in the future umm so im involved in the undergraduate study of women in math and one of the most recent activities weve been doing involves kind of an outreach project  umm for middle school and high school girls where we can bring them together and have them all do a collaborative math event as opposed to normal competition math  so i kind of experimented in the project to umm do that  it was originally aimed for just  ya know  local umm boston girls  so we did all the publicizing for that  i mean i know  get it a lot more publicity than we expected  people in from like california and stuff  so yup okay  umm so i guess im also a member of china development initiative  and so a lot of times  umm  when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that  but umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers so some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers  getting them to really correspond with us  like sometimes theyll respond and be like oh  were interested  but then they just dont follow up  so going after them  kinda looking for that response okay  umm i would say im generally more of a passive person  when someone gives me a task ill do it i wont really  like if i get stuck ill kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help umm so ive been trying to umm  i guess talk to more higher ups  if i run into issues  or ask more questions i guess umm we being okay umm i think i would bring a lot to the team in terms of  umm  teamwork in addition to the qualifications i have academically speaking  umm  i guess i would say that i have a lot of experience working with teams  umm a lot of experience in the analytic side of things as well  umm as well as a pretty interdisciplinary background in general  so i would be able to bring a lot more  umm  i guess  umm directions to the team ,4.72967036809,1,im junior mit im math major experience economic side thing cs simple coding interested go probably analytics trade future im involve undergraduate study woman math one recent activity weve involve kind outreach project middle school high school girl bring together collaborative math event oppose normal competition math kind experiment project originally aim ya know local boston girl publicize mean know get lot publicity expect people like california stuff yup okay guess im also member china development initiative lot time event within group brainstorm like service leadership program stuff like also try event bring professor speaker big challenge face include actually find speaker get really correspond u like sometimes theyll respond like oh interested dont follow go kinda look response okay would say im generally passive person someone give task ill wont really like get stick ill kind try keep work instead ask help ive try guess talk high ups run issue ask question guess okay think would bring lot team term teamwork addition qualification academically speak guess would say lot experience work team lot experience analytic side thing well well pretty interdisciplinary background general would able bring lot guess direction team
p56,um  well  my names ann im currently a junior in  biology im originally from san francisco um  i am interested in going to medical school and  i didnt really come to this decision until  like  around au  august or september of this year i was deciding  like  i mean  i always had it  like  in the back of my mind       cuz my dad is a doctor um  but  and i knew coming into college i wanted to study biology i wasnt sure if i wanted to do  um  like  research or  um  medical school so  um  i had a year off  or i still have a year off and of course  and i really liked it but i felt like research is something  uh  you have to be  like  self driven       to do and  i kept getting  like  frustrated because a lot of my experiments  they wouldnt work  and i felt really bad  and then  uh  i also  like  volunteer at a hospital just to  like  gain experience and see what its like and  uh  i enjoy helping people so  i think  decided for sure now  school um  i guess leadership can be  like  defined in a lot of ways  i guess one of my main activities that ive been doing at  is  um  working in a student group called esp  or the educational studies program and  um  so i teach an ap biology class on the weekends to the high school students in the area and i guess thats kind of like being a leader because you have to  like  stay in control of the class and organize everything um  i guess  um  the experience thats  like  most  like  strongest in my mind is actually from high school so i used to be on  uh  my high schools robotics team and  uh  none of us really  like  knew much about engineering or  like  building robots when we first started so it required a lot of  like  teamwork and working together um  i remember communication was one of our main issues because we would divide into subteams and then each subteam would  like  work on a part of the robot  but then sometimes we forgot to  like  communicate clearly with each other  and then that result in major problems down the road so     um  so i guess for us it was like a spe  special situation because  um  um  we were all  like  my friends and i  were all sophomores and then  there were no upperclassmen above us       on our robotics team so  our  like  very first years that we were the leaders of our team we really struggled because we didnt  we had no  like  prior experience        in how to organize a team so  like  after our first year  like  our sophomore year together  we  like  like  had a  like a sit down discussion afterwards         and  like  talked about what went wrong  like  what couldve been better so the next year we  we have  like  uh  we implemented  like  uh  daily meetings so  like  before we would  like  split up for the day and  like  work on our  uh  work on our robot we would  like  outline a plan and then  like  show it to everyone        and  like  discuss with everyone so that really helped they discuss  um  one of my weaknesses is im really shy like  i think when i was younger i go  i didnt like to  like  talk to strangers       or talk in  in front of a large group of people so  um  when i came to college i thought that  uh  i should try to improve that so  um  i think the main thing i tried to do was the teaching activity i talked about before um  requires me to  you know  stand in front of a group of high school students and talk for  like  three hours at a time so  i think  uh  im becoming a lot more comfortable  like  talking in front of people i dont really know that well um  i think i have  like  the passion to help people um  i  i had a lot of  like  volunteer activities  but i really enjoy helping people  especially  like  um  children so i used to  i used to tutor  like  young children at the cambridge community center and teach them how to read um  and im currently doing the  like  tutoring  i mean  not tutoring  the ap  teaching you know  um  so im  like  motivated to help people um  and i think that  like  as  especially as the world becomes  like  bigger  or the population gets greater  more and more people  like  will need medical help so  i think being a doctor would be a good  good way to help people  ,4.14499718593,0,um well names ann im currently junior biology im originally san francisco um interested go medical school didnt really come decision like around au august september year decide like mean always like back mind cuz dad doctor um know come college want study biology wasnt sure want um like research um medical school um year still year course really like felt like research something uh like self drive keep get like frustrate lot experiment wouldnt work felt really bad uh also like volunteer hospital like gain experience see like uh enjoy help people think decided sure school um guess leadership like define lot way guess one main activity ive um working student group call esp educational study program um teach ap biology class weekend high school student area guess thats kind like leader like stay control class organize everything um guess um experience thats like like strong mind actually high school use uh high school robotics team uh none u really like knew much engineering like build robot first start require lot like teamwork work together um remember communication one main issue would divide subteams subteam would like work part robot sometimes forget like communicate clearly result major problem road um guess u like spe special situation um um like friend sophomore upperclassmen u robotics team like first year leader team really struggle didnt like prior experience organize team like first year like sophomore year together like like like sit discussion afterwards like talked go wrong like couldve well next year like uh implement like uh daily meeting like would like split day like work uh work robot would like outline plan like show everyone like discus everyone really help discuss um one weaknesses im really shy like think young go didnt like like talk stranger talk front large group people um come college thought uh try improve um think main thing try teach activity talk um require know stand front group high school student talk like three hour time think uh im become lot comfortable like talk front people dont really know well um think like passion help people um lot like volunteer activity really enjoy help people especially like um child use used tutor like young child cambridge community center teach read um im currently like tutor mean tutor ap teaching know um im like motivate help people um think like especially world become like big population get great people like need medical help think doctor would good good way help people
p57,im doing very well  thanks how are you im currently a junior  pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and whats really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics a lot of interesting questions come up where its a lot of actually thinking innovatively and thats why ive chose to major in both of these and  actually  thats why im interesting in consulting is because its a good application of the problem solving that im doing in both of those umm  recently  i was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own task to do and it was a very straightforward class project  however  umm  these was  i noticed a lack of communication  a lack of set deadlines  so  umm  in that case  i kind of stepped up i organized communication between all of us i really got us on the same page and pushed us to a strict deadline and  you know  its a good thing i started when i did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline umm  ive also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured okay umm  last semester i was an event director for my sorority and what i had to do for that  the biggest event  especially logistically  fell under my responsibilities  so i  with a 2 200 budget  organized a dinner event for 200 people at restaurants across boston  so this involved  umm  finding places  making all food allergies were taken care of  really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening  and this also involved a lot of delegation because  you know  there were about 20 restaurants involved and i couldnt personally be in charge of all of those  so i had to delegate out to a committee  make sure that they knew what was happening  manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left  who hadnt gone as yet  everyone knew their reservations  how to get there  how to get back so  in that case  it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that umm  let me see i guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item i was just talking about where we werent all on the same page and not communicating umm  so i guess  in one of my classes last year  we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how  umm  and the way we kind of resolved that issue  because clearly  as an aspect  it needed to get done  we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out so the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time  whereas for the rest of us  we were more interested in the actual material  so we found a mutually agreeable solution yes umm  i think one of my weaknesses is that i tend to get very excited about everything im doing  you know  that  like  im a double major because i started in computer science and then i went oh  management really excites me too  i want to do that as well  which  in the past  has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit  which  as a result  when youre really excited about everything  but then you try to do everything  the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing  but im conscious of this year i cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars andespecially because last year  while doing all of those  i wasnt sleeping as much  which  you know  while i was still there and pulling my share and everything  you know  it was harder to be a full present member of anything if youre tired so this year i kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and im aware of that  so when i feel myself reaching my limit  ill actually try to prioritize more as i mentioned before  what im studying in school is very applicable to consulting  but  in addition to that  im really excited about the work that consultants do  especially  as i mentioned  im very interested in a wide range of fields and with you consulting you really get to explore a lot of those  delve into them  and in consulting id get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both  which is  again  the problem solving  the thinking innovatively these are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what i love to do  so i think i would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that ive spoken to really engaging and it seems  from all of my previous conversations with them  that theyre really excited about this  which is  you know  exactly what i would hope to bring as well ,6.02620075772,1,im well thanks im currently junior pursue degree computer science business whats really draw fact involve lot problem solve lot interpersonal dynamic lot interesting question come lot actually think innovatively thats ive chose major actually thats im interesting consulting good application problem solve im recently group project u kind task straightforward class project however notice lack communication lack set deadline case kind step organize communication u really get u page push u strict deadline know good thing start otherwise would miss deadline ive also lot leadership position want something little bit structure okay last semester event director sorority big event especially logistically fell responsibility budget organize dinner event people restaurant across boston involve finding place make food allergy take care really find everyone sorority need want evening also involve lot delegation know restaurant involve couldnt personally charge delegate committee make sure knew happen manage risk aspect keep track leave hadnt go yet everyone know reservation get get back case kind different style leadership delegation thing like let see guess first thing come mind item talk werent page communicate guess one class last year team project certain element thing none three u team know particularly interested learn way kind resolve issue clearly aspect need get do resolve make sure person take less responsibility elsewhere kind balance girl take happy main priority spending less time whereas rest u interested actual material find mutually agreeable solution yes think one weakness tend get excited everything im know like im double major start computer science go oh management really excite want well past lead kind overextend little bit result youre really excite everything try everything amount commitment give one reduce im conscious year cut little bit extracurriculars andespecially last year wasnt sleep much know still pull share everything know hard full present member anything youre tire year kind focus thing important im aware feel reach limit ill actually try prioritize mention im study school applicable consult addition im really excited work consultant

p58,good im a junior at mit studying ocean engineering and im really interested in working with big ships i love being on boats and by the water i am on the sailing team i spent the summer building underwater robots um  this last year  um  i restarted the section of the society of naval architects and marine engineers at mit we had one about five years ago when ocean engineering was course 13  but now its merged with the mechanical engineering department and when that happened the organization fell apart but i knew that me and some of the other ocean engineers wanted to really have our own society so i started it and i went to this meeting to how to get it all setup and got a professor to sponsor us mmhmm this last january i was working with my team in robotics team and we  there was a big conflict in the team because we thought we were going to build a six foot long glider  which is pretty huge the parts are so large and so heavy we couldnt machine anything ourselves we had to get it all done in a machine shop externally but we had to have a glider that size to like accomplish the goals for the glider which were look for oil um  so like  but then were were also working on a smaller version of the glider that didnt have all the sensors we needed  but otherwise had the same capabilities and it was more easier and more fun because we could machine everything and um  it was easier to understand the small piece but there was an awkward moment in january when half the team was working on the big glider and half the team was working on the small glider and we didnt know if we wanted to trash the big glider and work on the small one and so i was part of the team that decided that we should focus on the small glider so we took the design from the big glider and took as much as we could to put on the small glider and assigned people to work on the small glider one of my weaknesses is  i think  being aware of the energy that i bring into a room so when i am at meetings i really try to put positive energy into the room even if one day im really feeling quiet i make an effort to say things or make an effort to react to say things haha you should hire me because  um  i can bring good energy to a team and engineering experience  especially related to the ocean and ships related to the ocean and underwater vehicles and i have experience working on teams ,4.47985241982,0,good im junior mit study ocean engineering im really interested work big ship love boat water sail team spend summer building underwater robot um last year um restart section society naval architect marine engineer mit one five year ago ocean engineering course merge mechanical engineering department happen organization fell apart know ocean engineer want really society start go meet get setup get professor sponsor u mmhmm last january work team robotics team big conflict team think go build six foot long glider pretty huge part large heavy couldnt machine anything get do machine shop externally glider size like accomplish goal glider look oil um like also work small version glider didnt sensor need otherwise capability easier fun could machine everything um easy understand small piece awkward moment january half team work big glider half team work small glider didnt know want trash big glider work small one part team decide focus small glider take design big glider take much could put small glider assign people work small glider one weaknesses think aware energy bring room meeting really try put positive energy room even one day im really feel quiet make effort say thing make effort react say thing haha hire um bring good energy team engineering experience especially related ocean ship relate ocean underwater vehicle experience work team
p59,great laughs tired um  alright  i go to mit  course ten and seven um  i want to be a doctor im an emt what else is there a little sister hmm  i grew up here in florida  but i was born in toronto  uh  yeah laughs um  probably when i worked as an emt you know  youre there to support your colleagues and  you know  people have to trust you  if therere going to want to call you and thats the whole of this service  is that we want people to trust us  and  you know  taking on the extra work load and working  cus im an mit student  and  you know  taking nightshifts or working in between classes and pretty great responsibility  so um  i rode for six years  so  you know  its obviously a team requirement  so basically every time you show up to a race  thats a challenge  right and  i have a quote that hangs on my wall  and its training is the opposite of hoping so  its just working really hard to  sort of  prepare  for  you know  trying to achieve your goal because i think all the training  you know  thats how you make your own fate or  preparing  you know  preparing for a test  whatever and to work for it  you know  things dont come very easy  so i am a huge perfectionist so  you know  you inaudible into trivial things that  you know  you know  i shouldnt waste so much time perfecting and i i will  so thats thats probably the worst thing my boyfriend tells me all the time  hes like you have to stop expecting everything to be perfect im like i know  so uh  just trying to  like  put things in perspective i guess  so definitely became harder to do at mit you know  you cant be perfect because  you know  everyone here essentially is  so everyones very good at doing stuff  so um  i mean  because i work really hard i love it i dont see myself doing anything else with my life its weird inaudible why are you doing that  i dont know you know  i thought it was this thing  but i dont see myself  you know  sitting in a cubicle or behind a computer being like a code monkey um  i need a career  im up on my feet and i love interacting with people i love the science behind medicine and  um  you know  being able to change someones life i know its probably a pretty cliched answer  but its the only thing that like  i can see myself doing you know  adding productively into society  so ,3.89183885372,0,great laugh tire um alright go mit course ten seven um want doctor im emt else little sister hmm grow florida born toronto uh yeah laugh um probably work emt know youre support colleague know people trust therere go want call thats whole service want people trust u know take extra work load work cu im mit student know take nightshifts work class pretty great responsibility um rode six year know obviously team requirement basically every time show race thats challenge right quote hang wall train opposite hop work really hard sort prepare know try achieve goal think train know thats make fate preparing know prepare test whatever work know thing dont come easy huge perfectionist know inaudible trivial thing know know shouldnt waste much time perfect thats thats probably bad thing boyfriend tell time he like stop expect everything perfect im like know uh try like put thing perspective guess definitely become hard mit know cant perfect know everyone essentially everyones good stuff um mean work really hard love dont see anything else life weird inaudible dont know know thought thing dont see know sit cubicle behind computer like code monkey um need career im foot love interact people love science behind medicine um know able change someones life know probably pretty cliched answer thing like see know add productively society
p6,im doing good how are youthank you  well  um  my name is jeff  um i was born in japan i lived there for seven years before i moved to the  uh  us first  to michigan for two years and then to maryland um  and it was when i was in high school  or im sorry  middle school that i was exposed to um  a lot of different math  uh  science  advanced science courses um  it was where  um  i was exposed to a lot of um math competitions and computer science competitions and  it was around my uh  junior year in high school it was around my junior year in school because of peer and parental pressures i decided to do premed i decided to pursue  uh  a career in medicine um  so it was in high school that i decided start taking biology classes  physics  physiology  and  um  when i got here to mit i decided to major in course 20 um  and  after about four lab positions  two of the inaudible and two of chemistry that i realized  um  the course 20  the medicine track wasnt for me um  mainly because it wasnt quantitative enough or competitive enough  or fast paced enough for me but  with my last internship in the biotech industry  i had the privilege of talking to talk with several site directors um  it was because of and through that meeting i realized that i might really like finance  and that it might be more suitable for me um  and afterwards i started talking to some colleagues um  some finance majors and  thats why im here  um  i would say it was during high school there was this one group sophomore year we had to do this mission  this project called mission impossible where we had to design a rover that would uh  traverse  a uh  a uh  platform with quantum data the problem with the group was there was supposed to be a leader  but nobody really took an responsibility to do what they had to do that was partly due to the fact that nobody really individuals were assigned anything so  that was when i had to  i decided to take the initiative a couple of days before it was due actually  with the whole project  to uh  become the leader the unofficial itself leader as a leader i  uh  assigned a tasks to people politely  i asked them to do this because this was a very um coughs  multi prospective project that um it required programming construction and educating and  yeah  i decided to be leader and assign tasks and  i would say it was pretty successful the robot got in time it was due  ok  well i would like to talk about my past at my most recent internship at a biotech company um  and the problem was that i was working as an individual group it was because i was working with cells and  cells  the way cells work  is that um  that you culture them  like on say day 1 and  you let them grow like four or five or six  and then you let them grow until you collect  data and  the problem is youre not even cant collect the data on day one  you have to collect on day six and  if anything happens on day 3 or day four or something or sometime between day one and day five  the data will make no sense you would have to restart the experiment and  i was on a tight schedule and this was a ten week project and  in the first two weeks  i contaminated the cells um  both weeks  um and  so my data had to be redone  my experiment had to be redone the problem was that this was a ten week project and i had eight weeks to do one thing i learned about internships is to not panic when situations like such as this arise and  uh  what i did was  i went to people for help um  and i definitely spent more hours i talked to the hr department  i talked to my managers to increase my hours from 40 to 60 hours uh  so instead i went saturdays and sundays too in fact  there was this one point where i worked 23 days in a row  um and  uh  successfully  i think finished it in fact  after my data analysis and data compiling  uh  i presented my data to the site director he told me i had the most impressive presentation out of all the 21 other interns there um  so  yeah  it was during challenges like that  because of challenges like that that ive learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help  i think one of my weaknesses is that i dont have a formal education in finance um  i decided to be course 20  and um  uh  and i decided to pursue premed and  i was  i agree  uh  that it was a very sudden transition to math course 18 i think make up for that at least partially by  uh going to workshops  uh going to reading books  um i definitely have been networking with colleagues so  in terms of the financial models  uh  the mental math skills and the preliminary skills that i mean to  i believe i have a very strong grasp of those  well  i think  um  that compared to the rest of the competition  no one shows more initiative than i do and  in fact  i dont anyone has the technical skills or the willingness to work such long hours um  i think one of my strengths is that i dont have any problems with high expectations because i had to do such a sudden transition in career i had to do a lot research to convince myself that i wont have to do this transition again like i said  ive networked  ive done tons of research  ive read books  ive done tons and tons of research and you know  out to site directors  you know even out to first year analysts and  i know exactly what my job is and  i know that the long hours are tough and anyone else who says they like the long hours would be lying to you and  i know the exact skill sets required  and i believe i have those skill sets  thank you thank you for this opportunity  ,4.82624462496,1,im good youthank well um name jeff um bear japan live seven year move uh u first michigan two year maryland um high school im sorry middle school expose um lot different math uh science advance science course um um expose lot um math competition computer science competition around uh junior year high school around junior year school peer parental pressure decide premed decided pursue uh career medicine um high school decide start take biology class physic physiology um get mit decided major course um four lab position two inaudible two chemistry realize um course medicine track wasnt um mainly wasnt quantitative enough competitive enough fast pace enough last internship biotech industry privilege talk talk several site director um meeting realize might really like finance might suitable um afterwards start talk colleague um finance major thats im um would say high school one group sophomore year mission project call mission impossible design rover would uh traverse uh uh platform quantum data problem group suppose leader nobody really take responsibility partly due fact nobody really individual assign anything decide take initiative couple day due actually whole project uh become leader unofficial leader leader uh assign task people politely ask um cough multi prospective project um require programming construction educate yeah decide leader assign task would say pretty successful robot get time due ok well would like talk past recent internship biotech company um problem work individual group work cell cell way cell work um culture like say day let grow like four five six let grow collect data problem youre even cant collect data day one collect day six anything happens day day four something sometime day one day five data make sense would restart experiment tight schedule ten week project first two week contaminate cell um week um data redone experiment redone problem ten week project eight week one thing learn internship panic situation like arise uh go people help um definitely spent hour talk hr department talk manager increase hour hour uh instead go saturday sunday fact one point work day row um uh successfully think finish fact data analysis data compile uh present data site director tell impressive presentation intern um yeah challenge like challenge like ive learn panic stressful situation definitely branch help think one weaknesses dont formal education finance um decide course um uh decide pursue premed agree uh sudden transition math course think make least partially uh go workshops uh go read book um definitely network colleague term financial model uh mental math skill preliminary skill mean believe strong grasp well think um compare rest competition one show initiative fact dont anyone technical skill willingness work long hour um think one strength dont problem high expectation sudden transition career lot research convince wont transition like

lie know exact skill set require believe skill set thank thank opportunity
p60,so  umm im from chicago and im a junior here at mit  umm when i came here i was pretty sure i wanted to do health related work  so i guess i came in as a biology major and my dad is also a mdhp really interested  or really involved in research um  and so sort of that influenced me a lot so then i realized  after doing biology for two years essentially  that i wasnt really enjoying it laughs and so  i decided to try out computer science because this is mit after all and if i did want to do biology in the future  which its not that i dont like biology  its that i didnt feel like i was learning skills that would contribute to the field i guess and so  um yeah so then i decided to do computer science thats a very small part of me laughs thats a very broad question um  so i am the copresident of an organization at mit called glomet  and what we do is  were partnered with a nonprofit gratitude organization abroad  so our group is basically non profit we work with hiv health care work in togo  and so i guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester i suppose  its been a work in progress  its the first time ive ever been like in a presidents role in a group of about 30 people and all the records are new this year  its a new organization so its sort of like realizing  you know theres so many aspects of leadership  its not just like  not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show thats being maintained properly um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group um so i guess ive been learning a lot do you have specific questions about that okay so yea in terms of like leading a group of people that are like you know  my age  umm and were all like new at it  its definitely a work in progress but we do a number of things in terms of umm  we fund raise for so we hold campaigns and we fund raise  in order to basically fund our projects abroad in togo  so we are trying our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that were partnered with in togo  so we its hard sometimes motivating a group of people when your partner is abroad  its not like  we havent met them yet  and its a new partnership  so were traveling there this summer but since its new its kind of as a leader i think it takes a lot of like  not only vision and fore planning but like also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up you cant just do everything yourself even if that seems easier umm and then also like  maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives so thats the biggest challenge i think  but umm so i guess the same organization  we had a lot of umm  problems um  so  we are a team as an organization so last year i was like a director on the exec board  but not umm one of the copresidents  and the biggest challenge weve had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated  had very poor communication  and we didnt have  we just didnt really get anything done umm so a challenge on my part was not really  i wasnt sure  i knew what needed to get done and i knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know  motivate our staff  because its not like  its not just about us  we obviously  there are people that like depend on us and umm  the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time  while trying to trying to get them motivated but you know  telling  and i think a challenge was that they felt it was  they felt personally attacked when people criticize them or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so i think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you cant do everything  if that person is the president you just have to let them do what theyre gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right  but dont try to push  like you cant always push through things  sometimes you gotta just like go and like and i guess thats that did kind of solve the problem i mean  i didnt solve the problem of like  things not getting done but like i think realizing that actually helps a lot because it was just like banging your head against the wall so yeah laughs thats like also a weakness i guess i guess a weakness of mine would be that i am pretty umm knowing how to step back and not umm basically not trying to do everything myself when its definitely supposed to be a team effort  and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency so umm definitely giving people the chance to do the job right and sometimes you make second chances so i think thats i might have a bad temper sometimes that can be part of it laughs so yeah i think because im very motivated and i have a lot of self initiative and im hard on myself  so that sometimes i expect highly of other people in the same way  and that can  i mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that youve asked about  but i think that is umm good in  when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time and somebody who really takes like  self responsibility for things so i think if its for like a project for example  like a small group project its like good to have someone that isnt shy to speak up in a group and somebody that can sort of like organize the group to  to coordinate the group better like vocally laughs ,4.07119407478,0,im chicago im junior mit come pretty sure want health related work guess come biology major dad also mdhp really interested really involved research um sort influence lot realize biology two year essentially wasnt really enjoy laugh decide try computer science mit want biology future dont like biology didnt feel like learn skill would contribute field guess um yeah decide computer science thats small part laugh thats broad question um copresident organization mit call glomet partner nonprofit gratitude organization abroad group basically non profit work hiv health care work togo guess example leadership would whole semester suppose work progress first time ive ever like president role group people record new year new organization sort like realize know there many aspect leadership like objective group need get do also camaraderie group show thats maintain properly um lot really troublesome leadership experience last year group um guess ive learning lot specific question okay yea term like lead group people like know age like new definitely work progress number thing term fund raise hold campaign fund raise order basically fund project abroad togo try main project right improve technological efficiency clinic partner togo hard sometimes motivate group people partner abroad like havent meet yet new partnership travel summer since new kind leader think take lot like vision fore plan like also like able step back allow leader group step cant everything even seem easy also like maintain motivation among group people like really busy thing live thats big challenge think guess organization lot problem um team organization last year like director exec board one copresidents big challenge weve team co president motivate poor communication didnt didnt really get anything do challenge part really wasnt sure knew need get do know thing like need efficient take initiative know motivate staff like u obviously people like depend u problem like step toe time try try get motivate know tell think challenge felt felt personally attacked people criticize people try make suggestion good thing think solve problem step back like cant everything person president let theyre gon na wait til end job right dont try push like cant always push thing sometimes get ta like go like guess thats kind solve problem mean didnt solve problem like thing get do like think realize actually help lot like bang head wall yeah laugh thats like also weakness guess guess weakness mine would pretty know step back basically try everything definitely suppose team effort involve lot like trust people competency definitely give people chance job right sometimes make second chance think thats might bad temper sometimes part laugh yeah think im motivate lot self initiative im hard sometimes expect highly people way mean part challenge weakness question youve ask think good team people like need somebody meticulous delegate thing properly make sure thing do right time somebody really take like self responsibility thing think like project example like small group project like good someone isnt shy speak group somebody sort like organize group coordinate group well like vocally laugh
p61, i am in aerospace and engineering  and a    well with rotc you get a lot of   ah in unified last year  uhm we had the   one of my big weaknesses would be ah   well rotc is kinda forcing me into   slight laugh ah because im physically qualified and   ,4.44701561752,0,aerospace engineering well rotc get lot ah unify last year one big weakness would ah well rotc kinda force slight laugh ah im physically qualify
p62,mmm  hmmm im good   how are you umm  so my name is juliann  ok  uhh  just hold up  so what  what exactly would this interview ok ok   so im juliann  i go to mit  im currently a junior  im hoping to attend your  the medical school that im applying to   umm yeah im studying computer science and biology  which is a pretty new umm course here at mit  and currently im taking mostly biology classes  im also doing research in the hematology lab  and umm  yeah so a little bit about myself umm i guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college  i was born in tai i was born in california in irvine  umm and my parents and i moved back to taiwan when i was about 10  so i went to international school there  umm but yeah  most of my friends were pretty bilingual they spoke both english and chinese so i would say that im pretty you know fluent at both languages and yeah really look to both california and taiwan as my homes ok  umm lets see so i as i said im from taiwan and im  im part of a student group here at mit  called the association of taiwanese students  and what i actually was  was a cultural chair uh  for a year  and one of our main events is to create a night market  so umm  yeah  so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in asia  uhh we actually took it inside into our student center  so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs  so this included like the chinese students club  umm  the association of  sorry the asian american association  as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event  and so what my partner and i were in charge of was the food  and what we thought  we thought that this was you know  one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place  so umm  yeah i think that you know ha getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm  you know time everybody needed to set up  umm and we  yeah so my partner and i were in charge of that  and i thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something  umm  you know  arise out of that a team  umm  lets see  ok so over the summer umm  i actually  this last summer before my junior year  umm  i went to taiwan and china taiwan and hong kong specifically to teach and this was in groups of three  so there were two other mit students and i umm teaching in a group and so what this conflict arose  umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we werent sure because there were  there was also another group  another group of three teaching at the same time and we werent sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more  more time with all of the six instructors  umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks and so you know kind of a conflict arose out of that umm it was pretty much you know  three versus three  like three of us wanted  we thought that it would be a good idea to switch and umm the other three thought that you know they wanted to have a more personal relationship with their students and umm  yeah eventually what you know we we sat down at first it was pretty heated  umm  like so two of uhh  my colleagues  like one person from my team  and someone from the other  umm had you know really strong  strong ideas about umm what they wanted to do so  you know what i said was  hey  everybody like lets sit down and calm down  and you know think this through and talk it through  and you know i  i felt like i was one of the mediators in that  you know i didnt let myself get you know too involved at first  and i didnt let you know start screaming or anything like that  and i was really the one that said hey everybody sit down  umm  lets talk this through  and so we really just you know calmly and logically thought it through  talked it through  and you know we were like oh what would be the advantages of of switching and what would be the disadvantages and in the end we felt like umm the students were there to get breath and not necessarily depth  since it was only two weeks anyway  and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to umm have more exposure to all of the mit instructors from all different backgrounds ok i feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh  self confidence i  you know  im not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything umm  and you know there are people  like some of my friends are very much so people who are in the center of attention a lot and i think that thats something that i have been working on and will strive to work on umm in the future as well well i think that  you know  i laughs i ive demonstrated a lot of umm i have a lot of experience in the medical field  umm as a college student umm i do research in as i said in the hematology lab and i actually also work as an emt  so thats been a very  very large  big part of my life since umm last january umm  when i got my emt  ems umm license  and yeah so i actually work here at mit umm as a emergency medical technician  uhh  i work probably 15 hours a week on that umm  but moreso beyond my experience i really have a passion for the medical field umm  and i you know want to see help both the research that i do that you know  hopefully  in the future uhh  some clinical  the clinical work that i do will effect medical field ,3.9826335406,0,mmm hmmm im good name juliann ok hold exactly would interview ok ok im juliann go mit im currently junior im hop attend medical school im apply yeah im study computer science biology pretty new course mit currently im take mostly biology class im also research hematology lab yeah little bit guess want know little bit background college bear tai bear california irvine parent move back taiwan go international school yeah friend pretty bilingual speak english chinese would say im pretty know fluent language yeah really look california taiwan home ok let see say im taiwan im im part student group mit call association taiwanese student actually cultural chair uh year one main event create night market yeah instead know outdoors night market see city asia actually take inside student center work leadership bunch different club include like chinese student club association sorry asian american association well cultural club order create event partner charge food think thought know one big point event first place yeah think know ha get everyone group really sit look know much money allocate much know time everybody need set yeah partner charge think one time really show leadership make something know arise team let see ok summer actually last summer junior year go taiwan china taiwan hong kong specifically teach group three two mit student teach group conflict arise two week teach werent sure also another group another group three teaching time werent sure student really want u like switch class could get time six instructor want stick grup student complete two week know kind conflict arise pretty much know three versus three like three u want thought would good idea switch three thought know want personal relationship student yeah eventually know sat first pretty heat like two colleague like one person team someone know really strong strong idea want know say hey everybody like let sit calm know think talk know felt like one mediator know didnt let get know involve first didnt let know start scream anything like really one say hey everybody sit let talk really know calmly logically think talked know like oh would advantage switch would disadvantage end felt like student get breath necessarily depth since two week anyway felt like would lot good exposure mit instructor different background ok feel like one great weaknesses self confidence know im naturally somebody really want take center stage everything know people like friend much people center attention lot think thats something work strive work future well well think know laugh ive demonstrate lot lot experience medical field college student research say hematology lab actually also work emt thats large big part life since last january get emt em license yeah actually work mit emergency medical technician work probably hour week moreso beyond experience really passion medical field know want see help research know hopefully future clinical clinical work effect medical field
p63,pretty good  how are you all right um  i guess  to start with the basics  im uh  a junior at mit right now im studying course six three  its computer science and uh  i guess i didnt really get into computer science until last year and um  thats after i transferred here from the university of michigan and then uh  since then pretty much everything i do has been computer science  yeah all right  um  so this past um  this past summer um  i uh  got  well i guess last year  i got involved with an organization on campus called camp kasim and so  camp kasim runs a camp for the children of cancer patients and its um  its kind of a therapeutic camp  so the aim is for kids to just have fun and  anyway  we have various units that we break the kids up into to  that are divided up by age and um  i wasnt the unit leader for my unit but uh  there was a time when our unit leader had to go off and uh  it was either his break or he had to uh  go off and take care of some other stuff and so  uh  i was kind of given control of the unit and so um  it was an interesting experience  because we were dealing with kids but um  obviously the counselors were adults and college students  my peers all right um  so in  i guess  the last time i can really remember being part of uh  really intense team experience was um  in high school  i was on the year book as a photographer so um  we  i  my friend and i were both the head photographers so we  organized all the photos and so  we would coordinate with the editors and um  in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed  like what events needed to have photos taken of them  or what teams needed photos and  we would go about organizing the actual um  like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos and  so um  there we times when  like just getting  making sure that our photographers got to events uh  and like  and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um  was  could be very challenging because  i mean  because we were all very busy students and so um  one  like just  i guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like  really commit to their job and follow through on that and so  part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like  team culture and  a sense of like  comradery among the photographers themselves  um  you know  try to get people to um  like try to get people to go to event  even though  and they werent assigned just out of  like the eagerness to take photos and photography and so  um  we kind of approached this challenge and motivated  it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our  our um  peers and so  um  or like incentivizing these photos and  we approached by trying to  like build a sense of community and uh  like  like  and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos um  it was  it ended up playing out very well  but theres still a couple photographers who just  you know  they just didnt want to do the job  sometimes i mean  they  they usually had like  valid  some what valid excuses  but  yeah  but yeah this job still need to get done so uh  yeah  i mean  that was uh  pretty interesting team experience  sure  um  yes lets see  um  maybe one of my  id say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly uh  at times i struggle to uh  i struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what im thinking and so  i like  i find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence and um  theres some situations were  just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh  can be problematic and in other  in other situations  like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful  because ive  you know  i dont say anything  i dont tend to say anything rash and so  um  it has its merits but usually  its just in general  its nicer just to have a faster pace so  in kind of like conveying thoughts  um  um  so id say that im committed  hard working  uh  person and  in terms of this job i guess  uh  and my edge  can i describe what it is all right  so in my head its a software engineering position and so  i believe as um  i can contribute a lot to this  with the skills that ive gained here at uh  mit and  then also  i believe that i can gain a lot from the company  in terms of learning um  about what they do and how they do it and  i think it would be a good partnership  ,3.76316841209,0,pretty good right um guess start basic im uh junior mit right im study course six three computer science uh guess didnt really get computer science last

p64,so  umm i was wandering  umm im actually from russia i grew up in tulun  though  and i normally go to cambridge university which is  which is where i study here i am  uhh a foreign exchange student uhh with mit uhh i study course six umm mainly i focus my interest  split them more like uhh between umm the afternoon where i focus more on devices look like  nano electronics uhh processing methods umm circuits and also stuff that has to do with uhh i think it has to do with ai control machine loading umm so what im interested in ive been taking courses to that uhh goal  so things like 6034  6052  6017  umm in those same areas ive done several projects umm like something cambridge over summer  i did a i wrote a uhh simulator umm the simulator basically simulates a landing on mars and has to take in account physics umm graphics  planetary rotation umm and i have to write an ai which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch umm in a space craft umm similarly  ive also been participating in a robotics uhh competition in cambridge umm it was similar to mits mass lab umm and i was on the software team again uhh although i have done a little bit of electronics and the goal of that project was to  in a team of six  create a robot which is able to navigate a black uh sorry a white grid on a black table umm and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet based on whether uhh it was magnetic or not take it into a certain box  and i programmed the uh ai for that so thats the most experience ive had umm in cambridge here uhh ive considered participating in uhh umm battlecode or mass lab perhaps umm theres been some quite interesting projects going on umm in class those should be quite interesting  yeah  yeah it was good  pretty good umm  so umm again  in the robotics project uhh competition at cambridge umm in in our team of six i had to  in some ways  help out and direct the design choices in our  umm  for the competition uhh some things include deciding which sensors to be placed and where and kind of the overall idea was basically because i am running the ai  i have to umm have a clear idea of what the robot has to do  what its components are and i was the one to be the goto guy in case somebody had to make the decision up based on that and i made decisions uhh just based on rationality where umm if something was  the idea was that something has to be umm only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any more complications make problems  stuff doesnt work  breaks  umm so yeah and i also helped out with the electronics and sometimes the woodshure which umm sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that and i had to blast them on umm well what i wanted to be done for the ai to work properly umm another case of leadership  i guess  was i did military service in finland uh uhh as a citizen and  umm  so we had this  at the end of the service near to the end  there was a umm a anti air camp where all the anti air regiments and battalions were coming together at this one big training camp and as a member of the communication squad  umm we had to go and set up some things for the light fly exercises and because our sergeant was away doing some things  umm i really didnt know what he was doing  but ii had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people that  you know  these two guys  you know  do this cable and these guys set up the radio  ill do this and so yeah it was quite alright i guess that way umm well with the with the six people uhh we split each ourselves in three teams  three sub teams one was mechanical  one was electrical  and one was uhh ai now because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team  umm we said that itd be better if he was to help out with the mechanics cause there was umm a lot of hand work to be done uhh a lot of design work there and the ai is easily written by me  when umm i just kind of have a clear idea it was much faster then splitting with other people  it was rather simple ai i guess umm now  with the mechanics its much more important they get all this stuff done  leave some time in the workshop work so it was a decision we had to make umm to get more of that kind of get more of that hand work to the mechanical team  more man power to the mechanical team uhh with the electrical team umm we decided that we wanted the meaning doing most of the design work for the electronics cause you get a better idea and they also gonna be doing most of the soldering of electronic parts cause so we got uhh some basic components we we got this controller block umm with with a cpu inside but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and other controllers and all that so we had to do all those circuits umm so one of the guys  oscar  umm was much more into that so he took charge into design and uhh calvin did much more the soldering and stuff i kind of helped out when they needed some help umm so yeah we just needed to have a clear delegation of tasks and just do a bit of try if somebody needs something done wed be able to produce a kind of workingish result so that we could get stuff out so as an example  ii made a control system which uhh follows the lines way before i wrote any of the code for picking up stuff or testing what it is and how to choose where it goes the idea was that i am able to follow the line and turn umm which kind of tricky actually  so the way the sensors set up and the motors werent properly balanced and such umm so the mechanic guys managed to work together umm at a quick rate with just some of the basic plates they didnt they didnt cut them or anything they just got a plate  put some motors on  uhh hooked up the motors into the cpu  and did that and it worked i was able to make the ai which follows the lines which was pretty good umm also that that that did mean that the umm the oscar who made the sensor connectors umm he had to kind of work faster and make those particular circuits work before he made any other control circuits but delegating those things that way it  well will do a step by step  and do it gradually umm i guess one of my weaknesses is that i often get carried away umm i guess somewhat arrogantly umm when im working with something  and i think i have a really good idea of what i am doing  umm something is better than other umm i have a better idea of wondering than therefore try to tell them maybe theyre doing it slightly wrong be sort of somewhat more selfabsorbed in what resources need to be allocated because im doing a lot of stuff and they might be doing it more slowly so i can use this for longer or something umm not not to the point of insulting people but more sort of center of attention kind thing  i guess umm im trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that even though i think i have an idea of what im doing  i dont actually or that i might be mistaken so i kind of try to be more kind of chilled and laid back just yeah so yeah  but its a work in progress umm well you should hire me because i am capable of uhh pretty good verbal communication umm i dont really stress out much  i think  so im quite relaxed that way im able to speak three languages  so im able to communicate quite well  umm norwich  finnish  and english umm and i tend to be quite good at being able to delegate tasks to people so id be good for like a project lead  i guess because i have a pretty good technical background and i understand the tech and i quite enjoy working with the tech and i also like being with a team environment where i can delegate tasks and work on umm different things on on some things we can accomplish by ourselves on a larger project working on a team is quite fun if it works out right ,3.69357836245,0,wander im actually russia grow tulun though normally go cambridge university study foreign exchange student mit study course six mainly focus interest split like afternoon focus device look like nano electronics process method circuit also stuff think ai control machine load im interested ive take course goal thing like area ive do several project like something cambridge summer write simulator simulator basically simulate land mar take account physic graphic planetary rotation write ai account able land launch space craft similarly ive also participate robotics competition cambridge similar mit mass lab software team although do little bit electronics goal project team six create robot able navigate black uh sorry white grid black table able pick cylinder thing magnet without magnet base whether magnetic take certain box program uh ai thats experience ive cambridge ive consider participate battlecode mass lab perhaps theres quite interesting project go class quite interesting yeah yeah good pretty good robotics project competition cambridge team six way help direct design choice competition thing include decide sensor place kind overall idea basically run ai clear idea robot component one goto guy case somebody make decision base make decision base rationality something idea something complicate need complicated complication make problem stuff doesnt work break yeah also help electronics sometimes woodshure sensor hook control line stuff like blast well want do ai work properly another case leadership guess military service finland uh citizen end service near end anti air camp anti air regiment battalion come together one big training camp member communication squad go set thing light fly exercise sergeant away thing really didnt know ii take charge squad make sure cable do right delegate task certain people know two guy know cable guy set radio ill yeah quite alright guess way well six people split three team three sub team one mechanical one electrical one ai program experience much big program experience guy team say itd well help mechanic cause lot hand work do lot design work ai easily write kind clear idea much faster split people rather simple ai guess mechanic much important get stuff do leave time workshop work decision make get kind get hand work mechanical team man power mechanical team electrical team decide want mean design work electronics cause get good idea also gon na solder electronic part cause get basic component get controller block cpu inside wired sensor controller controller circuit one guy oscar much take charge design calvin much solder stuff kind help need help yeah need clear delegation task bite try somebody need something do wed able produce kind workingish result could get stuff example ii make control system follow line way write code pick stuff test choose go idea able follow line turn kind tricky actually way sensor set motor werent properly balance mechanic guy manage work together quick rate basic plat didnt didnt cut anything get plate put motor hook motor cpu work able make ai follow line pretty good also mean oscar make sensor connector kind work faster make particular circuit work make control circuit delegate thing way well step step gradually guess one weaknesses often get carry away guess somewhat arrogantly im work something think really good idea something well good idea wonder therefore try tell maybe theyre slightly wrong sort somewhat selfabsorbed resource need allocate im lot stuff might slowly use long something point insulting people sort center attention kind thing guess im try kind mindful people sometimes even though think idea im dont actually might mistake kind try kind chill lay back yeah yeah work progress well hire capable pretty good verbal communication dont really stress much think im quite relaxed way im able speak three language im able communicate quite well norwich finnish english tend quite good able delegate task people id good like project lead guess pretty good technical background understand tech quite enjoy work tech also like team environment delegate task work different thing thing accomplish large project work team quite fun work right
p65,yeah  pretty good um  dont feel particularly different from any other day um  so im from nearbell fosten sp  northern ireland i have three younger brothers  um  so  i think they have kind of influenced me as much as i probably have influenced them like  mark  the next one down  hes only a year younger than me  so he was always a lot sportier uh  coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that  i got into those sports um  and then ian  the next one down after him  is a lot more artsy and stuff  so i think because of his influence im kind of a bit more appreciative of things that i would have maybe just kind of  like  disregarded before um  like  um  when we was down in new york there we went to moma and there was like  um  the scream by munch or moonch       whatever  which was there  and some van gogh starry night and some lilies by monet so i  with that but you know what he will probably want to hear about this so ill go and ill take some photos for him um  and then harry is the youngest one  hes kind of like just gets away with everything  being the youngest but  um  should be pretty good to go back around christmas and catch it with them and stuff um  probably not get back over to cambridge in the uk over christmas break but i try to keep in contact with friends from there  through like facebook and stuff um  and yeah  just really enjoying my time here at the moment thats a little bit of background on me and my family  uh  so  this  im here on my third year  what you call junior year  my first two years in cambridge i was part of like the student council for the college there while i was in college so as part of that we do have like  we call it thrashers week  where as you kind of call it freshman rush  dorm exploration or whatever  um  so we had a big kind of end to that week  finale event that kind of took over college  like  multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the uk is 18  so everyone at university could drink  so there were different promotions on different  um  bars all over the place in the college  different attractions and stuff so  um  just kind of planning that  deciding what the theme would be  um  how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that  and getting music acts  um  getting promotions on the main bar  and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters  fire extinguisher points  emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections  particularly   being responsible for a particular area  i think thats quite a practical handson  time when ive been given leadership and i think i done well with it  it was  yeah right so  um  again going thinking back to cambridge in the uk  um  we  one of the things that cambridge is known quite well for is rowing  so i got to cambridge and i was like  ah  ive never tried rowing before  ill take this up so  um  in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it up and we continued it into our second year  but one of friends then decided he didnt have time for it and just kin kinda dropped it to the wayside  but we had the big kind of races that are towards the end of the summer there  theyre called the maybumps sp and obviously any kind of sport team work is important  but in rowing so much of it is just getting in time with each other  working as one  and it takes like the whole year to build up this so him deciding to   was really going to be massively detrimental  cause you can get someone to sub in and fill his seat but its not the same um  so  convincing him to stay on  as part of the team and kind of rallying like getting a good  like  boat spirit  that we werent just here guys that kind of rowed  but we all got along well and we actually wanted to row for each other and because i had been given responsibility as boat captain  no like the overall boat club captain  but that boat so  um  doing things like havin  um  prerace meetings together  and watching  like  video clips before  like kind of motivation rocky style stuff um  and just making sure like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between  yeah we need to train at this level to be good  but we dont need to go absolutely overboard  and we can gauge when people just need time off  or need time to unwind or destress um  so kind of implementing that and it came round to the actual bumps races  he hadnt quit and um  we managed to do a lot better than the previous term  previous term being a bit of a disaster  then this term we actually the best boat from the college so that was pretty satisfying um  like  again it just kind of shows  like  the races are painful and tough but you work together to get through them  you feel good after so that was like a pretty obvious sporting example of teamwork     um  i think overall im quite  like  confident and happy to talk to people and stuff  but maybe a weakness could be that sometimes i do dive into things a little too eagerly  like  um  it could almost be that i could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the  that extra confidence to just sit there quietly for 2030 seconds  think what the question actually specifically asked and answer it  rather than thinking  okay  theyve stopped talking  i better start  and just diving in with an answer and im coming across then as  perhaps  a bit frantic or not completely focused so i think some of that is just going to be practice   like do interviews  get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while i compose my thoughts and going into a well structured answer rather than just diving straight in with an answer as ive kind of been doing  i think  so far   um  i think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job  but  like  almost any job  um  in todays world isnt going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector its going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and i think that  like  ive used my university time so far in the uk and in america  really broadening the experience that ive got uh  broadening my  uh  ex exposure to different fields of engineering and also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even  like  artsy stuff um  i also think that through like projects  lab work  and things of that nature  i have the skills to work in a team be that  having the  uh  kind of humility to accept  okay  theres someone more experiences  more knowledgeable than me in this  ill take the lead from them or ill start realizing when its an appropriate time ill take the lead here because no one else is really going to  or im the best qualified to really take command   so  like  in terms of working with others  thats a strength that i have  um  and i think in terms of contributing to like  the overall atmosphere in the company  im quite a pleasant  optimistic person i like to think that im someone that others would be happy to work around  so not only would i be working well  but others would be working well  um  through my being there um  im not saying like im going to suddenly make the company  like  200 more profitable  but i do think that ill feedback in as much benefit as ill get out of a job that i genuinely enjoy ok thank you ,4.63501493131,0,yeah pretty good um dont feel particularly different day um im nearbell fosten sp northern ireland three young brother um think kind influence much probably influence like mark next one he year young always lot sporty uh come school always play rugby cricket get sport um ian next one lot artsy stuff think influence im kind bit appreciative thing would maybe kind like disregard um like um new york go moma like um scream munch moonch whatever van gogh starry night lily monet know probably want hear ill go ill take photo um harry young one hes kind like get away everything young um pretty good go back around christmas catch stuff um probably get back cambridge uk christmas break try keep contact friend like facebook stuff um yeah really enjoying time moment thats little bit background family uh im third year call junior year first two year cambridge part like student council college college part like call thrasher week kind call freshman rush dorm exploration whatever um big kind end week finale event kind take college like multiple music stage legal drinking age uk everyone university could drink different promotion different um bar place college different attraction stuff um kind planning decide theme would um go decorate colour tie get music act um get promotion main bar making sure cover health safety wise term enough canister fire extinguisher point emergency plan obviously work part committee responsible individual section particularly responsible particular area think thats quite practical handson time ive give leadership think do well yeah right um go think back cambridge uk um one thing cambridge know quite well row get cambridge like ah ive never try row ill take um first year friend take continue second year one friends decide didnt time kin kinda drop wayside big kind race towards end summer theyre call maybumps sp obviously kind sport team work important rowing much get time work one take like whole year build decide really go massively detrimental cause get someone sub fill seat um convince stay part team kind rally like get good like boat spirit werent guy kind row get along well actually want row give responsibility boat captain like overall boat club captain boat um thing like havin um prerace meeting together watch like video clip like kind motivation rocky style stuff um make sure like train hard people enjoy train right kind balance yeah need train level good dont need go absolutely overboard gauge people need time need time unwind destress um kind implementing come round actual bump race hadnt quit um manage lot well previous term previous term bit disaster term actually best boat college pretty satisfying um like kind show like race painful tough work together get feel good like pretty obvious sport example teamwork um think overall im quite like confident happy talk people stuff maybe weakness could sometimes dive thing little eagerly like um could almost could become good kind interview extra confidence sit quietly second think question actually specifically ask answer rather think okay theyve stop talk well start dive answer im come across perhaps bite frantic completely focused think go practice like interview get comfortable sit little bit silence compose thought go well structure answer rather dive straight answer ive kind think far um think obviously hire someone need qualification gon na allow well job like almost job um today world isnt go specifically tie one individual sector go require skill cross variety discipline think like ive use university time far uk america really broaden experience ive get uh broaden uh ex exposure different field engineering also use really quite amusing house program broaden exposure even like artsy stuff um also think like project lab work thing nature skills work team uh kind humility accept okay there someone experience knowledgeable ill take lead ill start realize appropriate time ill take lead one else really go im best qualify really take command like term work others thats strength um think term contribute like overall atmosphere company im quite pleasant optimistic person like think im someone others would happy work around would work well others would work well um um im say like im go suddenly make company like profitable think ill feedback much benefit ill get job genuinely enjoy ok thank
p66,im doing pretty good how about you yeah  its kinda shitty outside haha gotcha yeah i thought it was going to snow but ill take like drizzle over that uhm so im a junior obviously here at mit im studying chemical  biological engineering and minoring in economics uhm  i live in cap sigma which is one of the fraternities on campus im from chicago uhm  actually i was just home recently for thanksgiving uhm  and then  here on campus i obviously go to class and when im not in class i do the like getting involved in my fraternity as well as  uhm  i try to help with habitat for humanity so i do a lot with them and some community service stuff that we have as well oh cool where okay  im from siokee uhm  so  if i had to give i guess an example of leadershipuhm recently this semester id probably talk about uhm working with habitat for humanity like i mentioned before  uhm  im currently the president of the club and uhm so we do a couple of different things on campus here  both on and off campus  uhm  related to like international organization and so one of the big things we do on campus is we  uhm  have what we call the beaverdash and its a 5k run around the west end of campus and weve done it about 5 of them now so this year has since i was in charge of the club i had to organize it  uhm  and it was kind of a unique situation because uhm we were working with the presidents office uh combining with president griphes inauguration night actually they contacted me uh  which was awesome because  like  they have a ton of money and resources that i normally wouldnt have so i uh was able to work with that but i think it was a very interesting leadership posi uh  position because i was networking with my own execs which is 10 of my own students that i work with as well as the greater club which is about 100 kids that actively participate but then also in conjunction with the presidents office which is a couple people in uh staff  uhm with like  uh  the z center and things like that so we were all working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend so it definitely took like going to meetings with like staff and more important people in the world of mit and like relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done and selling tickets and actually running the event and coordinating the volunteers and things like that so i think it was a really good leadership opportunity and i worked with a lot of interesting people uhm  lets think of a good challenge uhm okay so  uhm  more recently  i was working on well im involved with my fraternity one of my objectives was to plan a little retreated that we have  like going camping so as part of that i work with a team of people  some of them are freshmen which is who the retreat is meant for some of the are my friend  well everyones my friend  but so its like an interesting dynamic because youre working with your friends but you have to kinda be managing them and stuff like that so that was like challenge number one but then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we had 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere the real challenge we had was getting people to commit and to count accurate numbers and stuff like that so i was really able to like in the context of the team organize people to go and personally talk to like all 60 people so we could get a feel for like who was actually coming because an issue we had in the past 50 people would say they wanted to come but only 40 people would show up those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars wasting and so its really important to get an accurate count and finding out who has dietary restrictions who had certain traditionally it is really nice to use like email to talk to people but here weve been really utilizing  uhm  actually going in person and having meetings together and breaking out and talking to individuals  and then  like  doing allocation of like  who  was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food purchase or stuff like that uhm so theres a lot of different allocation of  uh  tasks  and then  like individual talking to people and so those kinda overcame those different challenges yeah so  uhm  my greatest weakness currently  uhm  the best way i guess to phrase it would be i guess i feel like i need to be very involved in things i do whether they be like if im doing a project or leading an activity i feel like i need to be very on top of whats going on  which is of course a good thing you obviously if your in charge of something you want to be aware of whats happening but i think its my weakness because it allows me to not allocate enough to other people and it cop me to stress myself out and possibly not have as good as a final project because ive taken too much on for myself so thats obviously a kind of weakness and uhm what ive kinda been currently doing to counter it is uhm  really working on finding like friends to kinda like overview what im doing especially if im involved in very specifically delligating stuff to them and working on kinda like not doing as much and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and let someone work without checking in to really promote like letting them to go do their own thing and not concern myself with it obviously responsibly but also at the same time to not over burden myself okay uhhhmmm  sure uhm  so i think i bring a lot to the table by having been here for 2 and a half years here at mit ive gained a lot of technical skills  of course  ive taken a lot of classes and done a lot of laboratory research ive done a lot of projects through those classes and so i think i have a lot of technical skills and  uhm  i  in this position at this company would really have the ability to take these skills and combine them and applying them with the other skills ive picked up here which are leadership and communication skills uhm  cause right now theyve kinda been in separate realms where i do a lot of activities on campus where ive had the opportunity to plan events and ive kinda been able to take those skills and apply them towards like a technical related problem on which i would be able to do at this company and hone both of those together which i think would be very advantageous for me and very advantageous for you as a company  uhm  and really allow me to show off the abilities ive learned here yeah  of course ,4.51540977032,0,im pretty good yeah kinda shitty outside haha gotcha yeah think go snow ill take like drizzle im junior obviously mit im study chemical biological engineering minoring economics live cap sigma one fraternities campus im chicago actually home recently thanksgiving campus obviously go class im class like get involve fraternity well try help habitat humanity lot community service stuff well oh cool okay im siokee give guess example leadershipuhm recently semester id probably talk work habitat humanity like mention im currently president club couple different thing campus campus relate like international organization one big thing campus call beaverdash k run around west end campus weve do year since charge club organize kind unique situation work president office uh combine president griphes inauguration night actually contact uh awesome like ton money resource normally wouldnt uh able work think interesting leadership posi uh position network execs student work well great club kid actively participate also conjunction president office couple people uh staff like uh z center thing like work together organize large normal event conjunction activity go weekend definitely take like go meeting like staff important people world mit like relay message work like board get stuff do sell ticket actually run event coordinate volunteer thing like think really good leadership opportunity work lot interest people let think good challenge okay recently work well im involve fraternity one objectives plan little retreat like go camp part work team people freshmen retreat meant friend well everyones friend like interest dynamic youre work friend kinda manage stuff like like challenge number one real challenge coordinate essentially like people want go camp somewhere real challenge get people commit count accurate number stuff like really able like context team organize people go personally talk like people could get feel like actually come issue past people would say wanted come people would show people actually like hundred dollar waste really important get accurate count find dietary restriction certain traditionally really nice use like email talk people weve really utilizing actually go person meeting together break talk individual like allocation like go call various utility whether car rental food purchase stuff like there lot different allocation uh task like individual talk people kinda overcame different challenge yeah great weakness currently best way guess phrase would guess feel like need involve thing whether like im project lead activity feel like need top whats go course good thing obviously charge something want aware whats happen think weakness allow allocate enough people cop stress possibly good final project ive take much thats obviously kind weakness ive kinda currently counter really work find like friend kinda like overview im especially im involve specifically delligating stuff work kinda like much trust others stuff get job do let someone work without check really promote like let go thing concern obviously responsibly also time burden okay uhhhmmm sure think bring lot table half year mit ive gain lot technical skill course ive take lot class do lot laboratory research ive do lot project class think lot technical skill position company would really ability take skill combine apply skill ive pick leadership communication skill cause right theyve kinda separate realm lot activity campus ive opportunity plan event ive kinda able take skill apply towards like technical relate problem would able company hone together think would advantageous advantageous company really allow show ability ive learn yeah course
p67,im actually doing pretty well im just  uh  i would say  well  lets see its the end of the semester  right after thanksgiving break so  i have a bunch of time to relax and that sort of thing this is the first time i didnt get home though um  so i spent a bunch of time actually with my friends from my fraternity and  we had thanksgiving dinner together the turkey  the whole shebang um  most people around this time have all sort of exams  that sort of thing but  all things considered compared to like freshman  sophomore  junior year  um im actually taking an extra semester to technically still a junior um  its pretty relaxed things are good well  to start  um  i guess to start the three things im doing right now im president of my fraternity  sae  which i also helped start up its just one of the new fraternities that just you know came out of nowhere we were back on campus awhile ago  but thats history  um im a late grower  and im also a chemical engineer most people have to say course 10 for their major that sort of thing  uh and  im part of the growing engineer leadership program so  uh  all things considered  i would say that the the things that ive come to learn the most since coming to mit are leadership skills  being confident  being able to go in front of people  and  uh  sort of create a vision helping people follow that vision i have had issues in the past of time management but  i spent a long time doing  like freshman  sophomore year learning the importance of sleep bunch of things like that ive gone through the whole  all the trials and tribulations but  all things considered  id say pretty much right now  im smooth  like in a groove  doing my own kind of thing things that i want to do and  having a good time  well  just like this whole semester um  since ive been like the president of my fraternity there have been situations with people who are called brothers where  they  for some reason  they have these issues that they cant talk about im the kind of person that i can tell when someone is having i sort of like pry  not pry  but press a little bit until they either like to decided to like tell me more or tell me whats going on there was one case  in the sense that mattered  but there was a person that  um  that became a pledge of our fraternity  he came from the previous president its called rush talking over each other basically  what happened is this guy came in  and very few people knew him when he came in  but once they got to know him over the summer they didnt like him at all so  i had to deal with the situation of trying to find out what to do like  do we let him stay or let him go through the program and see if he improves or do we sort of like nip it in the bud right there uh  it brought  first off  i didnt even want to bring that information up until id talked to a bunch of people so  i talked to a bunch of people individually  got a feel for it then  i sort of predicted how the conversation was going to go ultimately  what ended up happening  was uh  we had to find a really nice way of letting the guy go it was sort of touchy feely sensitive stuff i really had to let  to make sure i talked to everyone before that happened  course 10 chemical engineering ice you are given a challenge in a team most people  you can actually choose your team most people throughout there are  there fun people  good at working with inaudible that sort of thing uh  but by the time i went to choose my team most of my friends had been swooped up so  i was working with kind of a random group of people which kind of worked out it turned out pretty well the project itself you have to design a chemical engineering plant so  you have to do the reactors  you have to do the flow  the mass flow  the distribution com center  etc and then theres a big report theres all sorts of stuff in general breakdown  theres one person who sort of becomes like the expert for the program  the aspen program and  then theres another person whose more like working on the actual write up  and then theres another person that sort of integrates the two what  what as the question working in a team ok  um  i guess the biggest issue that came up in that project was the deadline two and three days before the actual deadline  the final project was due  the main issue came up  the kiln wasnt working  the project wasnt working so  its a pretty typical mit scenario the main thing that was the issue was that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy so  he was like the silent coder that was off doing his own work  when youre trying to integrate it into the rest of the project  um  we should have collaborating a lot  but this other guy was sort of off in his own world so  when we needed his part of the project  it was sort of difficult to do so  what we had to do was we had to sit down all three of us together and go play by play with this guy to sort of get the medium that they left to  sort of get the project together um  and i would say the hardest part was just interacting with this man because he was very quiet he did get a lot of quality work done  but looking back  what i would have tried to do better was noticed he was a quieter person  and really tried to get him to be more  uh  evocative you know  sharing the thoughts and stuff that he was doing during like the feed the project we ended up delivering on time up to spec  but it would have been better if we had started with the issue at the beginning yeah  at the end of every single  like group that im with  everyone gets to the sort of critique phase where they see what theyve done well and what they havent done as well i can sort of like come of as being a little bit  well  gregarious is one thing um  but also sometimes i can sort of dominate a conversation um  so thats one thing i learned from the growing engineer leadership program and  the identify each of your skills  and find out that youre bad at it and  the thing that im really trying to work on is not dominating the conversation ive been working on it over the years and  the main ways i try to do that  is first off  dont be the guy who always takes the leadership role right from the get go what i do is instead if theres a little bit of  if some one is having a hard time  ill start giving suggestions and then people can start jumping on to those suggestions and  if i notice there is a person who is really good at  like engaged  who really wants to take this forward ill find a way to make it so they become the leader and  so instead of me directing everyone and sort of imposing  i really ask for everyones input and make it so everyone feels involved so  this is more of not a one example  but a change thats in progress i think  how i was at the beginning  just sort of loud mouth asking a lot of questions  like sort of this is how we are going to do everything now  its like i volley around ideas and try to get other peoples input instead  yeah  ive been thinking about that for awhile well  the thing about consulting  is that the main reason why its intriguing me right now is because its the kind of job where everything is fast paced but  two its the critical factor is teamwork working with other people who are a variety of ages being able to extract information and essentially be able to do a project that has a very short timeline it has a timeline  it has a scope  got a budget being able to do find different resources  make connections  and building relationships with new people which i think is one of the most important things  building relationships with people is critical and then being able to sort of patent those new projects while also being  find out  or getting a breadth  or a feel for so many different fields i thought about semiconductors and decide to not do semiconductors because of the class im taking right now i think team work is the most critical part of the matter  ,4.43546976733,0,im actually pretty well im uh would say well let see end semester right thanksgiving break bunch time relax sort thing first time didnt get home though um spent bunch time actually friends fraternity thanksgiving dinner together turkey whole shebang um people around time sort exam sort thing thing consider compare like freshman sophomore junior year um im actually take extra semester technically still junior um pretty relaxed thing good well start um guess start three thing im right im president fraternity sae also help start one new fraternity know come nowhere back campus awhile ago thats history um im late grower im also chemical engineer people say course major sort thing uh im part grow engineer leadership program uh thing consider would say thing ive come learn since come mit leadership skill confident able go front people uh sort create vision help people follow vision issue past time management spend long time like freshman sophomore year learn importance sleep bunch thing like ive go whole trial tribulation thing consider id say pretty much right im smooth like groove kind thing thing want good time well like whole semester um since ive like president fraternity situation people call brother reason issue cant talk im kind person tell someone sort like pry pry press little bit either like decide like tell tell whats go one case sense matter person um become pledge fraternity come previous president call rush talk basically happen guy come people know come got know summer didnt like deal situation try find like let stay let go program see improve sort like nip bud right uh bring first didnt even want bring information id talk bunch people talk bunch people individually get feel sort predict conversation go go ultimately end happen uh find really nice way let guy go sort touchy feely sensitive stuff really let make sure talk everyone happen course chemical engineering ice give challenge team people actually choose team people throughout fun people good work inaudible sort thing uh time go choose team friend swoop work kind random group people kind work turned pretty well project design chemical engineering plant reactor flow mass flow distribution com center etc theres big report there sort stuff general breakdown theres one person sort become like expert program aspen program theres another person whose like work actual write there another person sort integrate two question work team ok um guess big issue come project deadline two three day actual deadline final project due main issue come kiln wasnt work project wasnt work pretty typical mit scenario main thing issue guy responsible cod really silent guy like silent coder work youre try integrate rest project um collaborating lot guy sort world need part project sort difficult sit three u together go play play guy sort get medium leave sort get project together um would say hard part interact man quiet get lot quality work do look back would try good notice quieter person really tried get uh evocative know share thought stuff like feed project end delivering time spec would well start issue begin yeah end every single like group im everyone get sort critique phase see theyve do well havent do well sort like come little bit well gregarious one thing um also sometimes sort dominate conversation um thats one thing learn grow engineer leadership program identify skill find youre bad thing im really try work dominate conversation ive work year main way try first dont guy always take leadership role right get go instead theres little bit one hard time ill start give suggestion people start jump suggestion notice person really good like engage really want take forward ill find way make become leader instead direct everyone sort impose really ask everyones input make everyone feel involve one example change thats progress think begin sort loud mouth ask lot question like sort go everything like volley around idea try get people input instead yeah ive thinking awhile well thing consult main reason intrigue right kind job everything fast pace two critical factor teamwork work people variety age able extract information essentially able project short timeline timeline scope get budget able find different resource make connection build relationship new people think one important thing build relationship people critical able sort patent new project also find get breadth feel many different field think semiconductor decide semiconductor class im take right think team work critical part matter
p69,uh  so im uh  i guess i was born in dc  i lived in maryland until i was seven  then my parents decided it would be a good idea to move to nigeria which is where were from  and i lived the next seven years of my life there and i came back to america for junior and senior year of college  of high school  once i did that  um  in sag   but like during that period i sort of i found an interest in kind of engineering so i decided to apply at mit  you know its the best engineering school  and i uh  i got accepted there  and im here right now in junior year  uh  yeah  thats all acted as a leader  um  well  in my  one of my classes i was taking this semester  its  uh  212  intro to robotics  and it was  uh  like  the lab portion of the class is a group project and so there are four people and there has to be a team leader to get everyone organized and get everyone on the same page  everyone know whats going on  um  and i sort of volunteered myself uh  as a leader and its been  its actually been much harder than i thought working with different people who want do to different things i guess for this project and so just organizing everyone and sort of focusing everyone has been an interesting challenge   uh  uh  uh  i guess for my another class im taking this semester which is design and manufacturing theres a group of eight people and were tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred helios sp  um  yeah  and so  i guess the  the  the prerequisite to the class was  uh  design and manufacturing 1 where we had to make one robot  and sort of  that was more individual  but here were tasked with the  the big thing here is manufacturing and so i  its easy for everyone to want to decide to design this helio but you have to consider the manufacturing aspect  like how easy would it be to make if youre making a ton of them  and so this was a challenge getting everyone to agree on sort of one design idea and i sort of  i brought up  i made it  i made sure to let everyone know it wasnt just the design that were worrying about  its also  and more so  the manufacturing aspects uh  so im not  i say i like public speaking but im not very good at it  i say thats one of my greatest weaknesses  um  and sort of working on it hasnt been hard just because its something i like doing  um  and so  like  given opportunities i try to be the leader of a certain group  that way i talk to  im talking to the whole group a lot  that sort of helps my speaking  and just like in class projects  particularly humanities  i try to focus on taking ones where theres public speaking involved  not just writing essays okay yeah  sure uh  because i am as im a junior at mit and um  this is a good place to find sort of the best engineers  some of the best engineers in the world and student  sort of  interns and id do  id do a great job interning at this company sort of because of the experience i have previously and the knowledge  combine that with the knowledge im getting here at a world class institute  i think thatd make me wellqualified ,4.0394536969,0,uh im uh guess bear dc lived maryland seven parent decide would good idea move nigeria live next seven year life come back america junior senior year college high school um sag like period sort find interest kind engineering decide apply mit know best engineering school uh get accepted im right junior year uh yeah thats act leader um well one class take semester uh intro robotics uh like lab portion class group project four people team leader get everyone organize get everyone page everyone know whats go um sort volunteer uh leader actually much hard think work different people want different thing guess project organize everyone sort focus everyone interesting challenge uh uh uh guess another class im take semester design manufacturing there group eight people task design manufacturing hundred helios sp um yeah guess prerequisite class uh design manufacture make one robot sort individual task big thing manufacturing easy everyone want decide design helio consider manufacture aspect like easy would make youre make ton challenge get everyone agree sort one design idea sort bring make make sure let everyone know wasnt design worry also manufacture aspect uh im say like public speaking im good say thats one great weaknesses um sort work hasnt hard something like um like give opportunity try leader certain group way talk im talk whole group lot sort help speak like class project particularly humanity try focus take one there public speak involve write essay okay yeah sure uh im junior mit um good place find sort best engineer best engineer world student sort intern id id great job intern company sort experience previously knowledge combine knowledge im get world class institute think thatd make wellqualified
p7,hi  im jacob  pleased to meet you good  how are you im a junior at mit studying math and science and im looking for a summer internship at your company this summer so  im actually currently president of two student groups on campus  the educational studies program  which runs uh  large scale educational programs for middle and high school students where they take classes taught by mit students  and the mit mystery hunt   which is a one weekend event in january with thousands of mit students and other community members come to participate in a large multiday sort of puzzle competition  id be happy to go into detail about either of those but i have plenty of stories to tell okay  so one thing that comes to mind is a couple months ago i was in a robotics competition at mit called mass lab  so  its an autonomous robotics competition where you have to design  build  program the robot from scratch  and i was in charge of programming the robot for the team  we ran into several problems with the vision libraries we were trying to use in order to try to track the balls and field elements  just werent working for us  we spent probably the first half of the month trying to get these to work for the team and  um  eventually just decided that it would be easier for us to start from scratch and  uh  write everything ourselves  sort of by  you know  throwing out the assumption that we should work with the code we were given and starting from  principles we were able to actually  um  get our vision to   okay  um  i guess one of the weaknesses ive found is that i tend not to know when to ask for help  so  for instance at my internship last summer this is something that my mentor pointed out to me several times  if i got stuck on a problem i would just see what i could do about it  you know  google around for the solution  see if anyone else had encountered the problem and then only after a couple of days of trying to work around it then talk to someone  whereas  you know  if i just asked someone for help the first day they could say  oh  i ran into this problem last month  this is how you fix it and avoid me sort of this hassle of trying to google and figure it out on my own  so  i um  i definitely started to become more aware of this over the summer and made a conscious effort to  when i was having a problem  you know  look at my watch and figure out how much time i was wasting trying to solve it  if it got to me more than half an hour on my own i would just poke someone next to me and ask them  i think just sort of continuing that and trying to make sure that im keeping up the habit of ensuring that im not getting stuck on my own should help  okay  thats an interesting question  um  i think  i think so a lot of the candidates youve seen probably  um  come in with similar abilities  you know  students at schools like mit tend to be very top  at the top of their class  um  so  i wouldnt say theres much that differentiates me there  but i would say that i think i would get along well with your company um  i  people who have worked with me before have told me that im just sort of a fun person to be on a team with um  so  if you sort of look out to other aspects beyond just the numbers or gpa  or whats on my resume  you know  try to maybe you know  if you want me to hang around at  have  hang out at the office for a couple of days and  you know  work with you guys  we can see how that goes im confident that uh  youd think i  you would conclude that i would be a good fit here  any other questions ,5.57242669885,1,hi im jacob pleased meet good im junior mit study math science im look summer internship company summer im actually currently president two student group campus educational study program run uh large scale educational program middle high school student take class teach mit student mit mystery hunt one weekend event january thousand mit student community member come participate large multiday sort puzzle competition id happy go detail either plenty story tell okay one thing come mind couple month ago robotics competition mit call mass lab autonomous robotics competition design build program robot scratch charge program robot team run several problem vision library try use order try track ball field element werent work u spend probably first half month try get work team um eventually decide would easier u start scratch uh write everything sort know throw assumption work code give start principle able actually um get vision okay um guess one weaknesses ive find tend know ask help instance internship last summer something mentor point several time get stuck problem would see could know google around solution see anyone else encounter problem couple day try work around talk someone whereas know ask someone help first day could say oh ran problem last month fix avoid sort hassle try google figure um definitely start become aware summer make conscious effort problem know look watch figure much time waste try solve get half hour would poke someone next ask think sort continue try make sure im keep habit ensure im get stick help okay thats interest question um think think lot candidate youve see probably um come similar ability know student school like mit tend top top class um wouldnt say there much differentiates would say think would get along well company um people work told im sort fun person team um sort look aspects beyond number gpa whats resume know try maybe know want hang around hang office couple day know work guy see go im confident uh youd think would conclude would good fit question
p70,im good  how about you uh  so im a junior majoring in biology at mit um  im interested in approaching graduate school in biological oceanography um  im also doing a minor in chemistry i currently work in the thompson lab here at mit um  i would say  so uh im the vice president of campus outreach here at mits teenage beauty um  yeah so were in charge of generally reaching out to the student population here at mit um  so what ive done is basically try and form partnerships with maybe clinics in the boston area  like fenway health and try to get them to maybe set up screenings here at mit  um  i would say probably in my previous lab  this past summer i worked in israel and we were having a lot of trouble with just  um  figuring out a protocol for how to um culture the bacteria that we were trying to do so  it was generally  just like getting input from everybody and um trying not to get heated because we were kind of like  pressed for results  uh  i would say one weakness is probably that i dont  um  speak up very much  or i would prefer not to speak up maybe  so that probably maybe leaves opportunities or maybe give less input than i would in certain situations so um  what im doing to overcome that is probably more of  maybe not concrete things really  but hopefully just trying to get more experience so that i can maybe feel more confident about myself  i think because i really have a passion for this field i cannot imagine myself doing anything other than research it is definitely what i want to do for the rest of my life and i think i would be a good candidate for academia ,5.08800063289,1,im good uh im junior major biology mit um im interested approach graduate school biological oceanography um im also minor chemistry currently work thompson lab mit um would say uh im vice president campus outreach mit teenage beauty um yeah charge generally reach student population mit um ive do basically try form partnership maybe clinic boston area like fenway health try get maybe set screening mit um would say probably previous lab past summer work israel lot trouble um figure protocol um culture bacteria try generally like get input everybody um try get heat kind like pressed result uh would say one weakness probably dont um speak much would prefer speak maybe probably maybe leave opportunity maybe give less input would certain situation um im overcome probably maybe concrete thing really hopefully try get experience maybe feel confident think really passion field can not imagine anything research definitely want rest life think would good candidate academia
p71,uh  im an mit undergraduate junior studying mechanical engineering and  im doing the flexible course which allows me to concentrate  um  in an area other than mechanical engineering i chose building technology and im hoping to get a double minor in energy and architecture as well im sorry yes um  i have taken on several leadership roles in my sorority um  one of the most recent roles was a cpw chair so  um  our university  uh  holds a weekend  uh  to invite prospective students who have been accepted but have not decided to come to mit yet and its an important time to show them how great mit is but also to give them a taste of different activities on campus um  so i organized a dinner at our house with a cochair and then this year im planning all of our outersocial events so there are basically three large  um  formal events um so in high school i was really involved on the robotics team um  there  i had  three other teammates and it was very difficult to narrow down ideas  everyone had  like  different views  different opinions about how we should do things um  and i think that communication was the most important thing  making sure that like that we were putting our ideas on the table but also listening to each other  i thought that was one of the most important  um  factors in our success we ended up doing pretty well as a group yeah one of my weaknesses is  kind of  um  going out of my comfort zone as far as what im studying so i think that  uh  in high school because i was so involved in robotics i didnt really look outside of mechanical engineering and then my parents are also architects  which is where that came from so  there are two things that im really passionate about  but i feel that  especially being at mit there are so many other areas i am kind of neglecting particularly the arts  i just dont really feel  um  i feel its important to have a bounds and not really achieving that right now um  i believe that i have a very strong educational background in the field um  i  im really passionate about the subject its something that ive been exposed to in the past because my parents are architects um  but  at the same time  i think its something that i think is very important for the future  um  in terms of like energy consumption um  i wasnt sur i knew i wanted to go into some sort of like energy field at mit and i think i finally found one that i really enjoy laughs ,4.72711816786,1,uh im mit undergraduate junior study mechanical engineering im flexible course allow concentrate um area mechanical engineering chose build technology im hop get double minor energy architecture well im sorry yes um take several leadership role sorority um one recent role cpw chair um university uh hold weekend uh invite prospective student accept decide come mit yet important time show great mit also give taste different activity campus um organize dinner house cochair year im plan outersocial event basically three large um formal event um high school really involved robotics team um three teammate difficult narrow idea everyone like different view different opinion thing um think communication important thing making sure like put idea table also listen think one important um factor success end pretty well group yeah one weaknesses kind um go comfort zone far im study think uh high school involve robotics didnt really look outside mechanical engineering parent also architect come two thing im really passionate feel especially mit many area kind neglect particularly art dont really feel um feel important bound really achieve right um believe strong educational background field um im really passionate subject something ive expose past parent architect um time think something think important future um term like energy consumption um wasnt sur know want go sort like energy field mit think finally find one really enjoy laugh
p72,uh  good  how are you um  uh  so im rebecca im a junior  uh  studying linguistics um  and i think im interested in doing linguistic research after undergrad um  lets see  uh  so i did a  um  ra  i was an ra in my dorm  and we were in charge of leading the group of freshman  um  in advising them for academic reasons and  also in doing that organizing events around the dorm  so i would occasionally be in the  uh  in the leadership position for that um  lets see  uh  for a linguistics project we had to do  i was working on  um  a team  or a group project and and  uh  there was a problem one of the members  uh  wasnt contributing their work on time  uh  one of my weaknesses would probably be shyness um  or fear of like talking in front of people  i guess um  but so ive been doing more projects a lot of times in linguistics we have to give presentations so  um  ive been doing more of that and i actually  uh  volunteered to teach a splash class this fall  so that involves getting up in front of a lot of people and teaching something and that was actually really fun  so i feel like doing things that was sort of a way or and i enjoyed what i was teaching about  so it seemed less intimidating and i hope that doing things like that will get me over my fear of talking to people  so um  i think i have  uh  pretty strong credentials and  uh  doing well in my classes  and  um i really enjoy research and linguistics and i think i would  um  i think i work well with others and would be able to take on leadership roles if necessary and  um  i think i would just have a lot to offer ,4.76919910459,1,uh good um uh im rebecca im junior uh study linguistics um think im interested linguistic research undergrad um let see uh um ra ra dorm charge lead group freshman um advise academic reason also organize event around dorm would occasionally uh leadership position um let see uh linguistics project work um team group project uh problem one member uh wasnt contribute work time uh one weakness would probably shyness um fear like talk front people guess um ive project lot time linguistics give presentation um ive actually uh volunteered teach splash class fall involve get front lot people teach something actually really fun feel like thing sort way enjoy teach seem less intimidate hope thing like get fear talk people um think uh pretty strong credential uh well class um really enjoy research linguistics think would um think work well others would able take leadership role necessary um think would lot offer
p73,im good  how are you  im amanda  im a freshman at mit so im currently looking into too courses six and eighteen so and i play cello in the orchestra and im a part of sigma kappa yeah one time in high school i was the president of our youth board for united way which is a non profit that raises money and awareness for social and economic problems and then we build and try to change them and so my senior year as part of the youth board we ended up fundraising and starting a new fundraiser  and it was hockey game between our hockey team and a private schools hockey team which wasnt really a fair game  but thats okay and it was very down to the wire which we werent aware of  i mean planning an event around winter break is never really easy schedule wise and stuff  but it was definitely a challenge for us  but it was  it ended up being successful and we raised over 4000 for us yea  the organization is definitely one of my favorite  um  it lets students  um  like have a way to give back to the community which was a big deal for us since actually that year we lost three kids to suicides via train in a few months  and so it was really nice for us to have a way to like actually give back to our community instead of just thinking about it and wishing we could do something so  it worked out really nicely for us to like really make a difference i mean in school we get a lot of projects that are group projects and i have noticed that a tend to be a person who when the slack doesnt  you know the slack starts to happen  is kind of do it  and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone and so i remember senior year we just had this project  um  in math  and it was just so frustrating to do it by myself  and so i set every one and i was like i cant do this on my own anymore  and i really need your help  and it was really nice because they were my friends  and they didnt realize they were doing it  and so we like made up a new plan and re divied the work and it worked out in the end yea  im kind of a perfectionist and i like everything to work out well  which means that when im starting something new sometimes i cant look over the little details that i dont see that will work   and i dont get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goal  so thats definitely been one of my problems and i have been working on getting over that  but just thinking about it in the future and just you know you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvy it up into smaller tasks its a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything so i think you should hire me because i have had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up  like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with and you know of course not everyone can get their way but its important to try and get everyones ideas into one if you can so ,5.50660377243,1,im good im amanda im freshman mit im currently look course six eighteen play cello orchestra im part sigma kappa yeah one time high school president youth board unite way non profit raise money awareness social economic problem build try change senior year part youth board end fundraise start new fundraiser hockey game hockey team private school hockey team wasnt really fair game thats okay wire werent aware mean planning event around winter break never really easy schedule wise stuff definitely challenge u end successful raise u yea organization definitely one favorite um let student um like way give back community big deal u since actually year lose three kid suicides via train month really nice u way like actually give back community instead think wish could something work really nicely u like really make difference mean school get lot project group project notice tend person slack doesnt know slack start happen kind get tax pick everyone remember senior year project um math frustrating set every one like cant anymore really need help really nice friend didnt realize like make new plan divied work worked end yea im kind perfectionist like everything work well mean im start something new sometimes cant look little detail dont see work dont get look past see big picture come big idea work small detail later kind detail orient work big goal thats definitely one problem work get thinking future know get look big goal divvy small task lot easy overcome deal everything think hire lot experience deal people communicate make sure come like come best solution everyone hopefully agree know course everyone get way important try get everyones idea one
p74, okay  im a computer science major  um  im a  senior at mit and im hoping to stay in the area next year  im looking for a job here  and i grew up in south dakota and little bit in cambodia  grew up on a farm  i really enjoy playing music and cooking  probably my two biggest hobbies  well  when i was in high school i was the leader of my 4h club and that involved leading meetings  there were a lot of younger kids were involved and i helped them get involved in sewing competitions for example and  um  things where they could learn about nutrition  um  and showing their animals and learning about how to raise an animal well  so that was a big leadership role and it was kind of difficult but i definitely learned a lot from it um  i play music with some of my friends in some social settings  weve played for a couple of weddings and its sometimes difficult to coordinate  one of my weaknesses is probably procrastination  same as a ton of people  im sure  to overcome that i am trying to structure my time and i have a schedule so that ill do one thing for an hour and one thing for the next hour so if i procrastinate for the whole hour then i feel bad  so  the idea is to avoid that    i think that i am a strong  strong learner  definitely at whatever new skills since in web development theres always new technologies coming along  i am quick at learning those and i really enjoy learning new things  and i have a good base with my computer science degree from mit so i know in general how to think about programming ,4.64128690398,0,okay im computer science major um im senior mit im hop stay area next year im look job grow south dakota little bit cambodia grow farm really enjoy play music cooking probably two big hobby well high school leader h club involve leading meeting lot young kid involve help get involved sew competition example um thing could learn nutrition um show animal learn raise animal well big leadership role kind difficult definitely learn lot um play music friends social setting weve play couple wedding sometimes difficult coordinate one weaknesses probably procrastination ton people im sure overcome try structure time schedule ill one thing hour one thing next hour procrastinate whole hour feel bad idea avoid think strong strong learner definitely whatever new skill since web development there always new technology come along quick learn really enjoy learn new thing good base computer science degree mit know general think program
p76,im doing well thanks well  im zainab lasisi im a junior majoring in chemical engineering i was originally born in nigeria which is in west africa  and i grew up in england and jamaica before coming to mit  a time i demonstrated leadership id probably say  at the moment  um  in my position as the vice president of the african students association at mit  so as the vice president i have to be bas  i have to basically support the president and whenever the president of the association is not there step in and actually be the leader for the association  so the african students association is about an organization of  uhh  that consists of that comprises of about 80 africans at mit and  its just all undergraduates and its all about just keep the african community alive  and just  so that people know that they have a support system  within  uh  mit  cause most of them are  like  international students  so theyre very far away from home so its like having a home away from home for them yeah id probably say my past internship with bp  um  i was working on a team i was a process engineer intern and the challenge i had was that i was given a project that  they didnt really know what they hadnt  the project hadnt been done before its just something  like  they had ideas about what they wanted  but they had no clear cut visions or anything we just knew the  i guess  the skill set and the types of things they want from my project so for me  just to go about delivering a  a tool thats of use to the entire team it is about working with people  communicating  asking them questions about what exactly it is they what me to do and then doing then i did  like  a few modeling things and then ill show them and then theyll give me feedback  and then ill do some more so that was more about it cause i dont think they had an idea about what they wanted in the first place they just knew  okay  we want this model to do this and do that  and do that were not too sure how its going to do it  but  you know  just come up with some things  it was all on me to use my creativity and just pick peoples brains and just come up with deliver something thats of use to the team  i think on of my weaknesses is that  um id say im a very independent worker so  sometimes i try  like  i dont  i  i work too much by myself whereas in  i do work well in teams  but i just need to be more forth because when im given a project im like  okay  i can do this ill just try to sort it out so  i guess one of my weaknesses is  like  approaching other people especially people that im not  i dont really know and  like  asking them questions and things like that so  yeah something i need to  to develop my communication skills a little better so  i think that  i am i have a wonderful personality im great to work with i will do anything that is asked of me with a smile on my face ill always try my best  and  ill be a team player  ,5.53431847292,1,im well thanks well im zainab lasisi im junior major chemical engineering originally bear nigeria west africa grow england jamaica come mit time demonstrate leadership id probably say moment um position vice president african student association mit vice president ba basically support president whenever president association step actually leader association african student association organization consist comprises african mit undergraduate keep african community alive people know support system within uh mit cause like international student theyre far away home like home away home yeah id probably say past internship bp um work team process engineer intern challenge give project didnt really know hadnt project hadnt do something like idea want clear cut vision anything know guess skill set type thing want project go deliver tool thats use entire team work people communicate ask question exactly like model thing ill show theyll give feedback ill cause dont think idea want first place know okay want model sure go know come thing use creativity pick people brain come deliver something thats use team think weaknesses um id say im independent worker sometimes try like dont work much whereas work well team need forth im give project im like okay ill try sort guess one weaknesses like approach people especially people im dont really know like ask question thing like yeah something need develop communication skill little good think wonderful personality im great work anything ask smile face ill always try best ill team player
p77,mmhmm im goo im doing well  how are you um  so i  my background is in mechanical engineering what i really enjoy doing though  um is  leadership type rolls so i like talking with people but i also like doing technical problems so im looking for a position that really combines those two things uh where i can use my communications skills with people as well as my technical background in a roll thats kinda combin involves decision making  uh and different business factors  uh so  recently umm im the leader of our  of a group project that im working on basically what we have to do is design a speech system and with the system  uh  as leader of our team i do a lot of organizing delegating tasks  uh different types of conflict management  making sure people are talking  understanding whatever everybodys wanting  uh different type of  just general making sure im aware of all the group dynamics that are going on  okay  uhh so i was on a team  uhh  it was actually just two people  uh but it was to design and build a robot at the end of last semester  and uhh my partner and i have very different working styles  which i didnt expect i was kinda have projected my own tendencies on him in assuming that if i was going to finish something he would do the same way or work the same way as i  as i was going to uh but it didnt end up being true and so we ended up at the very end  uh  not having our final product ready  not having everything together and what i ended up doing was just making sure that i used all the resources i had  so friends outside of the project who um were willing to help with what was going on  uh to try to pull something together  made sure i was going to contact my professor and then try to communicate with him as much as possible  uh  to collaborate with what was going on in order to get um like uh somewhat finished final project  ther that was  our professor said was acceptable and done by the end  about the time we had finished wait  the time that we had to finish  uh i think one of my main weaknesses is  uh  taking on too many little things umm so sometimes not realizing  uh  what the little things are that i can let go for a little bit  and prioritizing  uh  large period of times of saying yes to too many things uh and what im mainly trying to do to change that is just keeping track of exactly how i spend my time so recently ive been really trying to focus in on  how long am i really wasting on little tasks  and how long im actually spending on larger tasks  um and i  and seeing that is very helpful  uh  in changing how i prioritize things im very dependable im responsible i will get things done when they need to be done uh and i like to communicate with people  overcome challenges  uh  i have been use to working with people with very diverse backgrounds and im not afraid of a challenge um  im also im use to being a team player ive worked on lots of team and know people so uhh  im also very excited about the vision of the company and whats going on and i think overall uh what ive learned here about the culture would fit me well  ,4.74113323385,1,mmhmm im goo im well um background mechanical engineering really enjoy though um leadership type roll like talk people also like technical problem im look position really combine two thing uh use communication skill people well technical background roll thats kinda combin involves decision make uh different business factor uh recently im leader group project im work basically design speech system system uh leader team lot organize delegate task uh different type conflict management making sure people talk understanding whatever everybodys want uh different type general making sure im aware group dynamic go okay team actually two people uh design build robot end last semester partner different work style didnt expect kinda project tendency assume go finish something would way work way go uh didnt end true end end uh final product ready everything together end make sure used resource friend outside project um willing help go uh try pull something together make sure go contact professor try communicate much possible uh collaborate go order get um like uh somewhat finish final project ther professor say acceptable do end time finish wait time finish uh think one main weakness uh take many little thing sometimes realize uh little thing let go little bit prioritize uh large period time say yes many thing uh im mainly try change keep track exactly spend time recently ive really try focus long really waste little task long im actually spend large task um see helpful uh change prioritize thing im dependable im responsible get thing do need do uh like communicate people overcome challenge uh use work people diverse background im afraid challenge um im also im use team player ive work lots team know people im also excite vision company whats go think overall uh ive learn culture would fit well
p78,um  im a junior in computer science what sort of things do you want to know about me i like programming in python  i havent been in computer science that long because i used to be a chemistry major  but ive been taking computer science classes for the past year and a half im the president of my acapella group so i have to organize publicity things like when we have a performance i have to make sure that everyone knows about the performance  so we have an audience i organize details like the reception and the getting a room reserved hmm ma time when i was working with a teami guess if i could count my acapella group as a team cause i guess it is there are times when weve had conflicts about weather we wanted to sing a specific song  for instance often times there would be a song that we really liked but it would take like up a lot of rehearsal time so we didnt think it was worth it or anything cause we had limited time so we had to resolve the conflict by discussing different options i think we finally ended up deciding to sing the song in a future semester later we would still be able to sing it but it wouldnt compromise the rest of our repertoire hmm mhahaum mmcant really think of things that where weaknessesum mmlaugh i guess that i have trouble being criticized because ive always been sensitive and  when i get criticized by people who arent as sensitive i  i react more strongly to their criticism than they intend me to so i have to learn to realize that some people who arent as sensitive will criticize harsh  more harshly because im excited to work at facebook and because im motivated to do things in computer science because i find it really fun ,4.32581402037,0,um im junior computer science sort thing want know like program python havent computer science long use chemistry major ive take computer science class past year half im president acapella group organize publicity thing like performance make sure everyone know performance audience organize detail like reception get room reserve hmm time work teami guess could count acapella group team cause guess time weve conflict weather wanted sing specific song instance often time would song really like would take like lot rehearsal time didnt think worth anything cause limit time resolve conflict discuss different option think finally end decide sing song future semester later would still able sing wouldnt compromise rest repertoire hmm mhahaum mmcant really think thing weaknessesum mmlaugh guess trouble criticize ive always sensitive get criticize people arent sensitive react strongly criticism intend learn realize people arent sensitive criticize harsh harshly im excited work facebook im motivate thing computer science find really fun
p79,im good  um im from mumbai  im a junior in core six  when i applied to itu i wasnt quite sure what i wanted to do  um i thought i would do chemical engineering  that um that got me super interested in a bunch stuff and um finally decided core six um but then i visit to the media lab before  um now im working at the over in um  so thats and engines i have been involved with engines here and um a bunch of other um clubs like energy club  and organizing the energy conference and and  other workshops  so um and in general im super interested in um hardware show and um computer science like certain aspects of computer science really interests me too so  yeah im interested you know to learn  um sure  so well this is the most recent example i can think of  but i um was a freshman  i was i mean i still am pretty excited about international developments so i joined um um as it was it was it was  it wasnt formally  in the usa but we decided to take it on       we wanted so we were willing um sort of  low cost easy to setup showers we use in kenya  um and it was basically something that ive never done before  computer science people you you know trying  but their view was       its not  so um that was a great thing for me to get involved with  and um that summer i went and traveled with them to kenya um and that was a great experience so coming back um i was uh elected as  that was um that was a great thing cuz one its its important to kind of realize that you might not have all the answers but thats fine  you know you can learn  you knew wanna be teens etc but it was like despite not knowing anything about mechanical engineering i was able to sort of understand and learn um sort of graduate to eventually becoming um    taking on a leadership within that community yeah um so we had this uh we had this asphalt called which is basically um you do you make them overlap and you sort of um pretend as if its something that youre actually making for industry and um there were four people on the team to program whereas there was me who was kind of like i know how to do it but you know i i could do with more instruction there was someone who was just starting she wa she was a freshman that year um but she was great and uh we decided to make this app with um when you have two iphones uh you can swipe like you can bump them and uh whatevers on one phone the other one could split them it was something that you know we we hadnt done before not a ton of people have done it and um at the media lab there was this technology that of i dont know discovered  um called swipe and they just swipe from one to the other and we we thought that would be great and it someone like a student like us who had done it um we but we we didnt realize that it was not production ready and then    and you know we have all these bugs and stuff and we have no documentation to go to but there was this one person on the team you know being you know the awesome programmer he is insisted on going that way when    like when we met the founder of swipe he was saying you know what just dont use it its not optimized for the stuff that you guys are sending       across like the data and um so we have the sort of tiff when you know the rest of the team wanted to move on to do the same project using the vpi which was kind of standard        and whereas we infinitely could deduce fiber we just didnt the resources at the time so um you know he was re he was really experienced and he cant even say you know you dont what you are doing because he       didnt know       what he doing so eventually we were able to convince him that we should probably go with whatever we wanted       um as a team instead of you know    etc um so that was that was definitely a challenging situation cuz hes great hes smart and hes super nice and you dont wanna offend anyone especially when theyre your friends you you have to get the work done is this a technical weakness or    ok um a lot of times this is just something that cody just taught me that i havent quite learned um is that whenever youre you know whenever youre in doubt you should just go ahead and do stuff but for me i like to like think about it how exactly im gonna lose one       if  coding which which which is a problem because sometimes like new solutions come along the way but you can like i do it fast um and its ok if stuff work the first time cuz i kind of wanted to research everything before       i start doing stuff um thats sometimes an issue because then i cant do it as fast if especially if thats something new but um on the other hand sometimes if it works like it works really well cuz ive done my you know homework right but uh in general i like if you just just get my hands dirty and then do stuff yeah um well because a year ago i didnt know how to code at all and now like like next semester im gonna finish up my degree um as a junior and then ill probably do math or something else but it that just kind of shows you that im willing to learn and im not afraid of trying new stuff and with this technology will always change and sure if i dont php today right now you can use it tomorrow but um i think whats really important is that im willing to learn um and i work well with within a team and i also like working by myself so theres like a good balance of what um stuff is  yeah i just like hanging with great people and doing great work ,3.79439931967,0,im good um im mumbai im junior core six apply itu wasnt quite sure want um thought would chemical engineering um get super interested bunch stuff um finally decide core six um visit medium lab um im work um thats engines involve engine um bunch um club like energy club organize energy conference workshop um general im super interested um hardware show um computer science like certain aspect computer science really interest yeah im interested know learn um sure well recent example think um freshman mean still pretty excited international development join um um wasnt formally usa decide take want willing um sort low cost easy setup shower use kenya um basically something ive never do computer science people know try view um great thing get involve um summer go traveled kenya um great experience come back um uh elect um great thing cuz one important kind realize might answer thats fine know learn knew wan na teen etc like despite know anything mechanical engineering able sort understand learn um sort graduate eventually become um take leadership within community yeah um uh asphalt call basically um make overlap sort um pretend something youre actually make industry um four people team program whereas kind like know know could instruction someone start wa freshman year um great uh decide make app um two iphones uh swipe like bump uh whatevers one phone one could split something know hadnt do ton people do um medium lab technology dont know discover um call swipe swipe one thought would great someone like student like u do um didnt realize production ready know bug stuff documentation go one person team know know awesome programmer insist go way like meet founder swipe say know dont use optimize stuff guy send across like data um sort tiff know rest team want move project use vpi kind standard whereas infinitely could deduce fiber didnt resource time um know really experience cant even say know dont didnt know eventually able convince probably go whatever want um team instead know etc um definitely challenge situation cuz hes great he smart he super nice dont wan na offend anyone especially theyre friend get work do technical weakness ok um lot time something cody taught havent quite learn um whenever youre know whenever youre doubt go ahead stuff like like think exactly im gon na lose one coding problem sometimes like new solution come along way like fast um ok stuff work first time cuz kind want research everything start stuff um thats sometimes issue cant fast especially thats something new um hand sometimes work like work really well cuz ive do know homework right uh general like get hand dirty stuff yeah um well year ago didnt know code like like next semester im gon na finish degree um junior ill probably math something else kind show im willing learn im afraid try new stuff technology always change sure dont php today right use tomorrow um think whats really important im willing learn um work well within team also like work there like good balance um stuff yeah like hang great people great work
p8,im doing great  how are you uh  so im an undergraduate uh in the third year  at uh  here at mit and im studying computer science um  i am really interested in um applying for a software jobum  i want to get more experience in web development and software development and also get some exposure into data science and machine learning and uh see how that plays out in uh the industry setting uh since ive done some research uhm  leadership so currently im on uh the south asian american students exec board so  thats uh basically uh the indian cultural club uh for undergrads and uh im secretary and community service chair um so im currently organizing um reaching out to groups in the boston area um and uh groups that work overseas in india with um for charity and community service opportunities that i can connect to uh undergrads hereum and uh im also involved in other activities that sas  the group  uh is involved in like setting up and planning like uh study breaks our recent uh garba  which is an indian dance festival and also in im in phi kappa theta fraternity and uh ive held leadership positions there  uh  in my freshman year in our pledge class when i was the community service chair for that  as well uh and  led my class of uh 15 in um going out into the community and we went down into different places in boston and helped clean up streets  etc  uh so  with this community service  uh  that my pledge class did for my fraternity um  one glaring problem was getting everybody to respond  communicate well  and show up uh  a class of 15 isnt too big but when were all mit students  were all just getting settled  its kind of hard to keep everybody on task um so  what i did to solve this problem was uh i once i set up one thing i did was set up a group text um that i would uh that would basically keep us on touch and um would facilitate making sure that everybody stayed involved and it would be easier to keep track also  of who was actually responding um because people check texts better than emails and thats what wed been using previouslyi also tried to um unsuccessfully  but um  propose uh like a point system  basically uh to reward those who would show up and penalize those who didnt so  we also we have chores basically in our house to keep the house looking clean house works and crews and um basically if you accumulated a certain number of um points points are baduh you would have to do extra crews or house works  depending on when you didnt show up for an event during our pledge process i think probably my biggest weakness is uh staying focused on tasks um  when i am working on a task and i am focused i am able to work really efficiently and i come up with good ideas uh but i frequently get distracted however  ive been um well on my way to overcoming this uh through friends working studying with friends who have like trained me to stay more on task uh done things like finding better places to work and study with back to school workum and uh also  sleep schedules are frequently a major problem for undergrads in terms of how that affects your study habits and so uh ive been working on that to help stay fresher and more focused when i do my work i think you should hire me because i have a lot of ideas im really good at coming up with ideas between table  especially in terms of um software development i um projects for school and one or two of my own independent projects ive been working on by myself and with friends ive uh  been good at optimization  um of software and coming up with good ideas um on the user end so  uh  im able to look at a project from different stand points and think about what all parties would want whatwhat would be easiest for the development team as well as the end users thank you ,4.57497972608,0,im great uh im undergraduate uh third year uh mit im study computer science um really interested um apply software jobum want get experience web development software development also get exposure data science machine learn uh see play uh industry set uh since ive do research leadership currently im uh south asian american student exec board thats uh basically uh indian cultural club uh undergrad uh im secretary community service chair um im currently organize um reach group boston area um uh group work overseas india um charity community service opportunity connect uh undergrad hereum uh im also involved activity sas group uh involve like set plan like uh study break recent uh garba indian dance festival also im phi kappa theta fraternity uh ive held leadership position uh freshman year pledge class community service chair well uh lead class uh um go community go different place boston help clean street etc uh community service uh pledge class fraternity um one glaring problem get everybody respond communicate well show uh class isnt big mit student get settle kind hard keep everybody task um solve problem uh set one thing set group text um would uh would basically keep u touch um would facilitate make sure everybody stay involve would easier keep track also actually respond um people check texts good email thats wed use previouslyi also try um unsuccessfully um propose uh like point system basically uh reward would show penalize didnt also chores basically house keep house look clean house work crew um basically accumulate certain number um point point baduh would extra crew house work depend didnt show event pledge process think probably big weakness uh stay focused task um work task focus able work really efficiently come good idea uh frequently get distract however ive um well way overcome uh friend work study friend like trained stay task uh do thing like find good place work study back school workum uh also sleep schedule frequently major problem undergrad term affect study habit uh ive working help stay fresher focused work think hire lot idea im really good come idea table especially term um software development um project school one two independent project ive work friend ive uh good optimization um software come good idea um user end uh im able look project different stand point think party would want whatwhat would easiest development team well end user thank
p80,mhmm awesome how about yourself well  i grew up in berkley  california and ive been interested in medicine my whole life um  my dad worked for ucsf as a researcher  but not as a doctor and i would visit him at work and i was always attracted to the hospital side its much the loud side i want to do research as well well in high school i was captain of golf team and that was a blast  golf  girls golf is not super competitive to say the least its veryhaphazard and its usually been one extreme or another very bimodal um  youve either got these like super serious girls  who are parents on the course with them and theyre going to be all pga or you just girls that are not that athletic just goofing off with golf clubs and doing whatever and berkeley high is definitely the ladder of that so i uh  you know  coordinated this group of motley girls along with my coach and we had a lot of competitions where candy was the reward we played a lot of gameswe had really a great time but a big part of it is like you know there was like a leadership aspect we had to like stay organized especially because no one else was and  so like making sure we made it to meets and likeorganizing snacks  making sure people showed up well  i mean i can continue the same example because i didnt start off as captain and its different  you know when youre the head versus like part of the group um  its more important when youre a part of the group to be a cohesive part and not like the leader to be able to like understand directions and likei mean if there is an issue likework it out  but to be able to take  you know  instructions and think about it and work with other people and encourage them to do the same  so  uh this is one time weve encountered an issue so we were going to a meet  and you have to travel a lot for golf because golf courses are big and not very common compared to something like a soccer field so we were going out into the xx of california and our car broke down and it was earrrly in the morning no one had no sleep it was just girlsteenage girls  no caffeine  not enough sugar  not enough breakfast and we were in a really old car and my coach was like 30 minutes ahead and we were going to be late we blew a tire actually so we called triple a  but it was stressful but  we ended playing games and i like led a yoga session in thehighway  which was  you know  hilarious and were there in these ridiculous outfits were wearing like we at berkeley high we wore like stupid outfits on purpose knee high argyles and like polos it was so funny you can only imagine how we looked um  yeah so im not super great with being organized like  im alright  but especially with administrative things like paperwork anduhm  iim good with deadlines  but only if i had set reminders so like even for example  trying to get into this building today was an adventure or remembering to fill out all the forms forlike my xx and everything isit can be sometimes sort of a struggle well  i love helping people and im going to be a great doctor i have good dexterity i like to study i find medicine fascinatingfascinating and i feel like i could really make the most impact that way i can utilizeutilize my skills the best way possible ,3.76562654207,0,mhmm awesome well grow berkley california ive interested medicine whole life um dad work ucsf researcher doctor would visit work always attract hospital side much loud side want research well well high school captain golf team blast golf girl golf super competitive say least veryhaphazard usually one extreme another bimodal um youve either get like super serious girl parent course theyre go pga girl athletic goof golf club whatever berkeley high definitely ladder uh know coordinate group motley girl along coach lot competition candy reward play lot gameswe really great time big part like know like leadership aspect like stay organize especially one else like make sure make meet likeorganizing snack make sure people show well mean continue example didnt start captain different know youre head versus like part group um important youre part group cohesive part like leader able like understand direction likei mean issue likework able take know instruction think work people encourage uh one time weve encounter issue go meet travel lot golf golf course big common compare something like soccer field go xx california car break earrrly morning one sleep girlsteenage girl caffeine enough sugar enough breakfast really old car coach like minute ahead go late blew tire actually call triple stressful end play game like lead yoga session thehighway know hilarious ridiculous outfit wear like berkeley high wore like stupid outfit purpose knee high argyle like polo funny imagine look um yeah im super great organize like im alright especially administrative thing like paperwork anduhm iim good deadline set reminder like even example try get build today adventure remember fill form forlike xx everything isit sometimes sort struggle well love help people im go great doctor good dexterity like study find medicine fascinatingfascinating feel like could really make impact way utilizeutilize skill best way possible
p81,ology in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the rain  um  and so thats im trying to get myself towards patent law  in pharmaceuticals i guess well  um  last semester i was  ah  a part of the mentor core for a student organization on one of mits campus called amphibious achievement  one of the things  as part of the mentor core you have a small group of students that you one on one tutor as their mentor and tutor and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session and theyre inner city high school students who  they dont have access to the best basic math and reading skills  so we meet once a week to go over what were going to teach them and we teach them the next day  on a sunday  uhm  and so thats leadership in itself  but i took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank our very generous donors and so me and another member of the mentor core planned  uh  a sponsorship banquet that i was told went very well  so  im very proud of that well  i guess the one thing that ive learned  uhm  working on several teams throughout my life is  uh  that communication is necessary  um  so  uh  in high school i worked on a team and we had received a grant in order to build an alternative energy  um  device  um  and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees  like so there was an electrical component and there were people trying to build the flotation aspect of it because it was  it was supposed to be in water and there was the water proofing committee  and so  in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations i think there was a  sometimes there could be a breakdown in that because everyones busy  and you see that here and i saw that a lot back in high school  um  and so i was kind of moderating everyone  um and so just being able to communicate the expectations  um  to make it really apparent  cause i think we running a lot of high achieving people a lot of the time  so as long as they know what they need to do and whats expected of them  i think  um  at least for me as a high achieving person  i  once i know what i need to do i can do it  and as long as thats communicated and clear i think thats necessary to resolve a lot of problems id say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization  so if theres something i know that i need to do  um  i will definitely get it done  but in terms of parsing out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently before hand  sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times im scrambling at the last second  i always get it done  but its just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end  um  but i have  ive gotten a lot better at that  especially at mit  because you really cant mess around with that kind of  uh  weakness  just with  knowing my schedule the month before versus the week before hand  and investing in a planner and a calendar has definitely helped me a lot i think because  you know  ive wanted to do it since i was twelve and i think i have a lot that i can give  coming from mit have a backlike the mind set the science and engineering  um  as and adding that into like the sphere of law i think it would introduce a unique problem solving set and i could have a lot to offer to  uh  the community of lawyers across the nation ,5.46399215651,1,ology order learn like pharmaceutical aspect rain um thats im try get towards patent law pharmaceutical guess well um last semester ah part mentor core student

p83,umm  im good  im good umm  so  im a junior at mit im studying brain and cognitive science im interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future probably systems level ok umm  well  this past summer i was in china and  umm  i was helping out with this cognitive learning program and what they do  is they try take principles  umm  learned through research  and apply those in the classroom and so interviewee we were applying those  umm  to students who were in sixth grade  trying to teach them english and  it was  it was great so  i got to actually  like  umm  go there and teach a class of sixth graders for the whole summer so  umm  and they let me develop some of their curriculum  which was very cool and  umm and it was a great experience overall ok umm  well  actually  a part of the same program  uh  we were trying to put up videos of the teaching to give  umm  examples for other people and  uh  none of us knew how to program or anything like that  and we were  we were in china  so it was  umm  both a language barrier and also  you know like  overcoming that  like  knowledge gap of not knowing how to program so  what we ended up doing was  like  trying to find a chinese student who was studying computer science  and  umm  in beijing  and  the language thing did come in to play  but  umm  but eventually  we were able to  like  sort of  get through that it was a challenge all the way through yea  umm  so  i have trouble public spe  like  getting up in front of people and talking umm  which is part of why i came in to this interview umm  but also this semester  i joined the debate team umm  which has been great  so far umm  basically  we go around to different colleges for tournaments and  umm  we get up and we just speak for  for an hour and  umm  and thats  thats really helped out so far umm  because  i  i want to make a difference in this field umm im very  very committed to this   i mean  i know this is what i want to do i mean  theres really nothing else i can see myself in the future doing i mean  i love it  im fully committed  and  umm  id  id like to make a difference here ,5.37244412606,1,im good im good im junior mit im study brain cognitive science im interested study cognitive neuroscience future probably system level ok well past summer china help cognitive learning program try take principle learn research apply classroom interviewee apply student sixth grade try teach english great get actually like go teach class sixth grader whole summer let develop curriculum cool great experience overall ok well actually part program uh try put video teach give example people uh none u know program anything like china language barrier also know like overcome like knowledge gap know program end like try find chinese student study computer science beijing language thing come play eventually able like sort get challenge way yea trouble public spe like get front people talk part come interview also semester joined debate team great far basically go around different college tournament get speak hour thats thats really help far want make difference field im commit mean know want mean there really nothing else see future mean love im fully commit id id like make difference
p84,im well thank you  how about yourself  um  well as you probably know  im a junior in mit  ah material science and engineering  and ive spent a bit of time doing some research in material science  but ive also recently declared a maj  ah  minor in course two which is  sorry  its mechanical engineering umm  so  im looking for a bit of practice in industry now that ive had some research experience  ive a lot of range of classes in engineering   and im hoping to  ah  to kind of try out what its like to engineer  um   combine the two basically  mechanical and materials engineering  ok  um  i could give you an example of a club im in um  in  at mit im in amnesty international  which is a student human rights organization and its very  um  decentralized  its very student owned  and  uh  we kinda make it what ever we wanna make it at any given time  so it takes a lot of initiative to really hold the club together  and  uh  we were trying to pull together a big event last semester which involved professor n and we had to talk about arab spring and we were hosting it in a huge lecture hall  um  so big venue  hoping  expecting a lot of people um  but it took a lot of work and none of us had really pulled such a huge event before so  um  id say it took  it took a lot of initiative that i hadnt taken before in pulling that event together i came to meetings and made sure everyone was on task  made sure  that everybody had an awareness of what could go wrong as well as what could  um  what kind of repercussions we might be expecting if things did fall out of hand with the high  high profile speakers  as well as some  you know  some contentious issues being discussed  so  um  yeah i did my best  to really pull the team together as best as i could  um  i didnt have an official leadership role so  my participation was ambiguously defined  but  um  it was fun having  uh  having a role um  thats a good question um  so i was on the orientation group  i was an orientation leader this  this  the beginning of this year  and so  we paired off into different groups  uh  we were the brown team  and we had a few problems with getting energy with the team  and  uh  all of these freshman we knew that they were excited to be there  we knew that they wanted to get to know each other and mit  but there was just  there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have  so  we  uh  we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team  we had a group discussion  after i think it was the second day  and  we took this  um  we took a few tries to pull together some new ice breakers that hadnt been in the booklet that they prepared us for  and just  uh  whipped that out the next day  started yelling  got the kids off their feet and jumping  and um  my  one of my other coorientation leaders and i were yelling different questions at them and they had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them  and   it didnt really work necessarily  um  everybody participated though and it got them  got the blood moving  and it go them kind of talking to new people  so even though the game didnt have a point  it ended up being kind of fun  it was a good  good way of getting to know my teammates a well  so we worked together really well on that  yes um  so i have a weakness for overcommitting sometimes  and  uh  what i have been doing in the last year or so  well since i came to mit  but particularly this year is cutting back on things that dont mean much to me cutting back on things that are  that have always just been interest that i never see myself progressing in so  um  for example  i was  uh  i took a small leadership role in my sorority  like  my  my freshman year  but i wasnt  i dont see myself going very far in leadership in my sorority  so i cut that kind of thing out and ive been focusing on classes  sailing  im on the sailing team  and  uh  amnesty international  and those are my three main focus things  so although  i do do other things like i was and orientation leader  um  when i have time i give tours  from  thats my job campus tour guiding  but  um  ive been getting better  ive been staying more on track with classes this way  and  um  having sailing has definitely helped  so a bit of selfdiscipline and  uh  cutting back on things has  helping me  uh  not overcommit  um  because ive researched into your country  sorry into your company  and  um  i think  uh  i think its  i see a lot of  i see a lot it in the experience that ive had  in  ive had international experience in companies of a scales similar to yours  although  it was in the research department  um  and  i think i cold bring that  coo  that  um  international perspective  ive lived in several countries as well  uh  and i have  besides being and engineer  i have a lot practice with team work and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups  even in my pset groups  um  doing homework we have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of  uh  group reports where the materials signs major here  and  ive really  uh  ive developed a lot of skills that i think will really help your company   ,5.51848839033,1,im well thank um well probably know im junior mit ah material science engineering ive spent bit time research material science ive also recently declare maj ah minor course two sorry mechanical engineering im look bit practice industry ive research experience ive lot range class engineering im hop ah kind try like engineer um combine two basically mechanical material engineering ok um could give example club im um mit im amnesty international student human right organization um decentralize student own uh kinda make ever wan na make give time take lot initiative really hold club together uh try pull together big event last semester involve professor n talk arab spring host huge lecture hall um big venue hop expect lot people um take lot work none u really pull huge event um id say take take lot initiative hadnt take pull event together come meeting make sure everyone task make sure everybody awareness could go wrong well could um kind repercussion might expect thing fall hand high high profile speaker well know contentious issue discuss um yeah best really pull team together best could um didnt official leadership role participation ambiguously define um fun uh role um thats good question um orientation group orientation leader begin year pair different group uh brown team problem get energy team uh freshman know excited knew want get know mit something block talk get orientation uh pull together bit brown group team group discussion think second day take um take try pull together new ice breaker hadnt booklet prepare u uh whip next day start yell get kid foot jump um one coorientation leader yell different question pair group base question ask didnt really work necessarily um everybody participate though got get blood move go kind talk new people even though game didnt point end kind fun good good way get know teammate well work together really well yes um weakness overcommitting sometimes uh last year well since come mit particularly year cut back thing dont mean much cut back thing always interest never see progress um example uh take small leadership role sorority like freshman year wasnt dont see go far leadership sorority cut kind thing ive focusing class sail im sail team uh amnesty international three main focus thing although thing like orientation leader um time give tour thats job campus tour guide um ive get well ive stay track class way um sail definitely help bite selfdiscipline uh cut back thing help uh overcommit um ive research country sorry company um think uh think see lot see lot experience ive ive international experience company scale similar although research department um think cold bring coo um international perspective ive live several country well uh besides engineer lot practice team work leadership roles community student group even pset group um homework pull together lot presentation lot uh group report material sign major ive really uh ive develop lot skill think really help company
p85,okay so im a junior here at mit  im   um and i guess so its an interesting combo but engineering and ecs and i think i just came to mit thinking id do bioengineering and then i guess i took a program class for the first time my freshman year over ip and i guess i just really fell in love with the logic i worked in a couple of biology labs and i guess the one frustrating thing is that like experiments take weeks or months to set up sometimes things just go wrong and you dont really know why and then i think i like the instantaneous feedback of like  so last year i decided to double major and this year im really checking out the more computer science side of things okay um so i think im on my class council  so one of the things we have to do was to seven people elected every year our job was to plan events for the class for event unity  just like study breaks but sometimes it goes beyond that and i guess through that role often times ive um just like seen an idea from inception all the way to its now in planning to like delegating tasks to day of  to day of execution and just following that entirely through so i guess that just involved first just coming out brainstorming some ideas so like for example this past week on tuesday  since its a hell week for many people at mit we decided to have instead of like a big study break where people had to go on campus  we rented out a cookie monster truck from boston and then just drove around we had six stops on campus to like it was all the dorms and even across the river to bring the study break to them so people didnt have to spend that much time just cookies and hot cocoa so i guess my role is well i thought of the idea and then just coordinate the people and made shifts to people and designed the stops and then just made sure publicity was good and everything came together in the end okay so i guess im in a fraternity and then one of the things we have like a lot of officers and i guess one of the things is that sometimes people obviously its mit people get very busy and i guess one of the things is people maybe they have an ambitious goal and then it just happens that they get busy or like they lose track of things and then uh they get side tracked and its always challenging to try to keep them engaged into that officer position and like because for a couple of reasons one like do you want to make it rewarding for then  two you want to see them follow their goals  and three theyre like setting an example for say like younger students or other people that may be interesting so i guess the challenge then is to overcome this so im usually following up with them individually seeing  like  maybe like  hey like whats up are you no longer interested in this are you just busy and then i think it depends on like a case by case basis like are they just maybe a little bit absent minded then maybe like setting like weekly just like deliverables or like milestones or goals to like get it done piece by piece is one way if theyre not interested anymore maybe you try to think of like some other idea that they may be interested in or willing to plan to maybe they can work in a group with someone else so someone else can keep them on track so i guess its just tailoring to the solution to the individual problem okay um i think sometimes i can be um a little like  uh like unsure of myself or like doubting when making a very large decision so i guess usually in leadership roles i prefer something like second in command since i do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure but i always like the fall back of having someone else to consult with to talk about uh my thought process and things like that and i guess generally i try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people like other people on the team or someone else you would maybe not  but has experience in the field just to maybe illustrate my thought process  see if they see any flaws  see if they see maybe  a perspective i didnt think about and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that i feel more confident in my own decision or like i reevaluate it to account for things that maybe i didnt think of before um so actually thats one of the things like im hoping to figure out  okay okay so i guess the job i picked was just to listing like richard keppel where like they listen to a lot of pitches and they decide like what to fund and i think the reason why i want to  should i say why i should or why i want to have that job okay so why i should have the job is i think at mit ive gotten a lot of exposure to a lot of different things one is through the breadth of my coursework i guess im in two very different fields another is just through my interaction with people on campus like being on class council  being involved in a fraternity   i guess i um ive seen like a lot of different groups of people and um i guess im just constantly around lots of awesome people with awesome ideas and i really enjoy just listening to them and then a lot of the times ive helped people to develop maybe theyve got a gold mine of a plan and ive helped them work through  especially like sophomores or freshman in the fraternity  putting that plan in action so i think that i would be a good candidate because ive had experience listening to ideas  i can identify problem areas just because i have a lot of experience executing those ideas so i can both see what might be a good idea technically as well as to see if theres a good plan to set forth an action and get it done thank you ,4.37642746289,0,okay im junior mit im um guess interest combo engineering ec think come mit think id bioengineering guess take program class first time freshman year ip guess really fell love logic worked couple biology lab guess one frustrating thing like experiment take week month set sometimes thing go wrong dont really know think like instantaneous feedback like last year decide double major year im really check computer science side thing okay um think im class council one thing seven people elect every year job plan event class event unity like study break sometimes go beyond guess role often time ive um like see idea inception way plan like delegate task day day execution follow entirely guess involve first come brainstorm idea like example past week tuesday since hell week many people mit decide instead like big study break people go campus rent cookie monster truck boston drove around six stop campus like dorm even across river bring study break people didnt spend much time cooky hot cocoa guess role well think idea coordinate people make shifts people design stop make sure publicity good everything come together end okay guess im fraternity one thing like lot officer guess one thing sometimes people obviously mit people get busy guess one thing people maybe ambitious goal happen get busy like lose track thing uh get side track always challenge try keep engaged officer position like couple reason one like want make reward two want see follow goal three theyre like set example say like young student people may interest guess challenge overcome im usually follow individually see like maybe like hey like whats longer interested busy think depend like case case basis like maybe little bit absent mind maybe like set like weekly like deliverable like milestone goal like get do piece piece one way theyre interested anymore maybe try think like idea may interest willing plan maybe work group someone else someone else keep track guess tailor solution individual problem okay um think sometimes um little like uh like unsure like doubt make large decision guess usually leadership role prefer something like second command since like make sure thing get do like follow make sure always like fall back someone else consult talk uh thought process thing like guess generally try overcome basically reach people like people team someone else would maybe experience field maybe illustrate thought process see see flaws see see maybe perspective didnt think generally try get viewpoint feel confident decision like reevaluate account thing maybe didnt think um actually thats one thing like im hop figure okay okay guess job pick list like richard keppel like listen lot pitch decide like fund think reason want say want job okay job think mit ive gotten lot exposure lot different thing one breadth coursework guess im two different field another interaction people campus like class council involve fraternity guess um ive see like lot different group people um guess im constantly around lot awesome people awesome idea really enjoy listening lot time ive help people develop maybe theyve get gold mine plan ive help work especially like sophomore freshman fraternity put plan action think would good candidate ive experience listen idea identify problem area lot experience execute idea see might good idea technically well see there good plan set forth action get do thank
p86,umm  like where im from  that type of stuff okay  umm  im junior  mit i come from south florida  born and raised  so cold weathers kind of rough for a guy like me but thats alright its kind of a nice break from the heat of south florida umm  ive been playing music ever since i was four  so thats kind of been a big part of my life umm  but music tech  i mean  technology honestly also  so umm course two here  which is mechanical engineering  um  but im also dabbling in electrical  looking along for sides of control that type of stuff robotics  if you will and just had one of my  my second or third robot finished last week  which was a freakin nightmare but you know  its ok  its done  it was  it was a good time  so  yeah thats  thats what i do yeah  umm  i guess thats yeah  alright yeah leadership um  well i guess im  uh  usually pretty calm and collected  so  if i ever notice  like  in a group setting if someones like  you know  theres  theres disagreement between the two  like in my robotics group  for example the two guys  theyre best buds  but they often  like  just get really heated  like  you know  i  eff you  why  why dont we just do this  and that type of stuff so  in order to  like  keep it going and being productive  someone has to be like you know  just  guys  just calm down and keep doing it  so thats  thats like  just  here and there not really superlike im in control  you know  at least saying guys  we need to calm down and take a step forward i feel like thats a little  minor leadership role ive got to take there um  other leadership roles  um  i  i play in a group  like a band  jazz group  so i often  you know  we all got to get together  and like  kind of talk any  any group setting in which im often in  i have to  like  somebody has to take control  and i dont often take control initially  but  you know  if something is not going in a certain direction  or the right direction  i often feel like maybe i can push it there very subtly so  leadership in a very subtle way  but not in a  like  a bam  im telling you what to do thats  thats what i like doing um  okay  so  for example  the robotics group  um  we worked very last minute  and just having to be one of those things where we were all busy with other things  and we didnt really think about the scheduling  like when it was actually  when the project was actually going to be due so  um  basically we all had to work really hard  last minute  and  of course  you know  things dont always go according to plan  so we  like  we tried to build one thing  and machine something  and it ended up not being perfect the first time  so we have to go back and redesign it  or remachine it  so uh  we had to remachine a few things a couple times and  you know  its like  six in the morning  and youve been working in the lab for like  thirteen hours and youve got to keep going  so  youve got to stay positive and keep  and  you know  even though you may not finish  or like  you know  you kind of  you cant really think about not finishing you just have to go for it  keep finishing  keep working  eventually youre good  with the mind set that you are going to finish so thats  uh  adversity in that way just  you know  always stay positive  and keep looking towards the future  keep working so um  timemanagement  um  is one of my weaknesses  which is not always the best to admit in an interview  but you know  whatever  uh  thats alright what ive been doing to get better about it  is  you know  sometimes youve got to look like  even a week in advance  ive discovered  especially at mit  isnt as far as you need to go so  like this  this week for instance  i had  like  three  like  a final robot project  another presentation i had to take care of  and  you know  a lab  a couple psets like  you just  i didnt realize how much work was coming up until like  last thursday or something like that  which is when i started working  but even then  you know  i didnt have enough time i really should have started working  you know  monday  on it  when i was just relaxing  and was like oh  you know ive got psets to do this week  but i can really relax and it will be all right so  uh  in terms of improving that  just i  you know  got to work  write up a schedule  and look  really far in advance  make sure i really see whats coming yeah  so ive been trying  ive been being better it started off  i started college  like  i didnt see things for like  three days in advance  two days in advance now its kind of like  a week  week and a half im looking in advance im getting there  slowly but surely yeah okay uh  yeah sure for that job  you mean umm  i feel like i know what im doing now um  ill say there was a point in time where i didnt feel like i knew what i was doing  and ive been one of those guys that  like  you know  you can apply to a job  and say  you know  yeah  theres no harm in applying  which ive kind of figured out  eventually  yeah there is no harm in applying  i agree but  at the same time  i feel like theres kind of  like a  an obligation to actually know what youre doing for that job  and right now i feel like i know what im doing at least  a lot more so than i did last year  or even last semester  so at the rate im going  i feel like  you know  another semester of classes that im taking  ill really know what im doing  and then some more time in the field  or at the job  itll piece together and ill actually feel pretty confident so  thats  thats why  i guess yeah ,3.24920388012,0,like im type stuff okay im junior mit come south florida born raise cold weather kind rough guy like thats alright kind nice break heat south florida ive playing music ever since four thats kind big part life music tech mean technology honestly also course two mechanical engineering um im also dabble electrical look along side control type stuff robotics one second third robot finish last week freakin nightmare know ok do good time yeah thats thats yeah guess thats yeah alright yeah leadership um well guess im uh usually pretty calm collect ever notice like group set someone like know there there disagreement two like robotics group example two guy theyre best buds often like get really heat like know eff dont type stuff order like keep go productive someone like know guy calm keep thats thats like really superlike im control know least say guy need calm take step forward feel like thats little minor leadership role ive get take um leadership role um play group like band jazz group often know got get together like kind talk group set im often like somebody take control dont often take control initially know something go certain direction right direction often feel like maybe push subtly leadership subtle way like bam im tell thats thats like um okay example robotics group um work last minute one thing busy thing didnt really think schedule like actually project actually go due um basically work really hard last minute course know thing dont always go accord plan like tried build one thing machine something end perfect first time go back redesign remachine uh remachine thing couple time know like six morning youve work lab like thirteen hour youve get keep go youve get stay positive keep know even though may finish like know kind cant really think finish go keep finish keep work eventually youre good mind set go finish thats uh adversity way know always stay positive keep look towards future keep work um timemanagement um one weaknesses always best admit interview know whatever uh thats alright ive get well know sometimes youve get look like even week advance ive discover especially mit isnt far need go like week instance like three like final robot project another presentation take care know lab couple psets like didnt realize much work come like last thursday something like start work even know didnt enough time really start work know monday relax like oh know ive get psets week really relax right uh term improve know get work write schedule look really far advance make sure really see whats come yeah ive try ive well start start college like didnt see thing like three day advance two day advance kind like week week half im look advance im get slowly surely yeah okay uh yeah sure job mean feel like know im um ill say point time didnt feel like know ive one guy like know apply job say know yeah there harm apply ive kind figure eventually yeah harm apply agree time feel like there kind like obligation actually know youre job right feel like know im least lot last year even last semester rate im go feel like know another semester class im take ill really know im time field job itll piece together ill actually feel pretty confident thats thats guess yeah
p89,um so im a junior at mit here and um im a physics major and i uh  yeah  besides classes  im involved in the juggling club and uh lets see and im from pensacola  florida and ive lived there uh ever since i  i was born there  grew up there and i um yeah  lived there and moved up here yeah im in zeta psy fraternity and uh yeah so  yeah  right above chicago pizza and uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail  or just general yeah  um yeah so i uh i dont too much as far as extracurricular but i was involved with frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team  theres not a varsity team here i was pretty good  liked that a lot and uh im not sure as far as career wise what i want to go into but as a physics major im looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related uh and yeah but im trying to size that up right now juniors a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things yeah so brief summary of me um well high school uh senior year probably the best time i helped organize a math competition um so there was no major middle school math competition in pensacola  florida and so i just teamed up with a few people with my year in high school and we helped organize a competition its been going on for the past three years and uh hopefully itll go further that was one of the most stressful things but the most rewarding as well and yeah so as far as leadership goes i mean more recently i guess juggling club has been my main leadership thing  we organize different gigs and perform various places so um so that would most commonly have been this past semester  i took junior lab which is the physics lab class lots of challenges frequently it was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically i guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment i guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because its so easy to i dont know get like get in your head and youre working with somebody so theyll be thinking one thing and youll be thinking another yeah i guess thats not very specific but i mean yeah thats the first thing that came to mind so yeah weakness i guess i uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that ive kind of come to the realization of recently i need to um i dont know ive been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what ill do after selfadvocacy is like a huge thing and i havent really gotten too much into that but i feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like selfadvocacy whether its like having your own website or just like general networking i dont know thats something that i realize that i need to kind of work on um yeah why do i think i should have this job um i feel like im a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic i feel like i really do have those strengths yeah i feel like i communicate pretty well for um  im not saying you know general physics majors cant communicate well  just in general i feel like especially this past semester ive taken a lab classes ive been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um i kind of found a strength there and so i think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important so um yeah i feel im pretty qualified there ,3.14449073711,0,um im junior mit um im physic major uh yeah besides class im involve juggling club uh let see im pensacola florida ive live uh ever since bear grow um yeah live move yeah im zeta psy fraternity uh yeah yeah right chicago pizza uh yeah want go detail general yeah um yeah uh dont much far extracurricular involved frisbee freshman year little bit play club team theres varsity team pretty good like lot uh im sure far career wise want go physic major im look something technical probably electrical engineering relate uh yeah im try size right junior pretty pivotal year know decide long term thing yeah brief summary um well high school uh senior year probably best time help organize math competition um major middle school math competition pensacola florida team people year high school help organize competition go past three year uh hopefully itll go one stressful thing reward well yeah far leadership go mean recently guess juggling club main leadership thing organize different gig perform various place um would commonly past semester take junior lab physic lab class lot challenge frequently partner work three different experiment um specifically guess let think yeah three major experiment second experiment hand cool also mean lot faulty equipment guess general thing learn kind talk easy dont know get like get head youre work somebody theyll think one thing youll think another yeah guess thats specific mean yeah thats first thing come mind yeah weakness guess uh far kind general thing ive kind come realization recently need um dont know ive kind get along undergraduate career know ill selfadvocacy like huge thing havent really gotten much feel like major thing like take next step like graduation like selfadvocacy whether like website like general network dont know thats something realize need kind work um yeah think job um feel like im pretty creative person know bit technical background good work ethic feel like really strengths yeah feel like communicate pretty well um im say know general physic major cant communicate well general feel like especially past semester ive take lab class ive able give lot oral presentation um kind find strength think kind bring solid communication element technical field pretty important um yeah feel im pretty qualify
pp1,umm  so im a computer science and biology major here at mit  im a junior and im expecting to graduate in june 2014  ahm  im interested in kinda doing both research and  as well as practical application of some type of biological research with computational engineering involved  sorry  would you like to know more or is that alright uhm  i do  i would say that when situations present themselves i step up to the occasion  im not afraid to take the lead on a project or like  for example i guess  um  for one of my computer science projects that we were working on a group together one of our teammates wasnt working well  i wasnt afraid to kind of step up and take the lead  and be like hey we gotta get this done  and  um  its kind of happened multiple times before i guess   um  so one of the other organizations i do is camp kesem and im actually on their exec board and so a lot of what we do is we plan out the summer camp for our kids whose parents have cancer  and a lot of times were just debating simply like how exactly we want to get  uh  or how we want the whole camp to you know  uh  kinda go day by day we need plan out the whole schedule  so we have a lot of conflict because everyone has all these different ideas and this is a very team oriented board and although its got the normal hierarchal structure  uh  we do a lot of things like just simply by like mapping them out on the board and visualizing the day and schedules and planning between us and what the teens have to do where were able to come up with a solution together  so i would say that its a good example of me being one of a team and coming up with a solution together um  i think id like to be more interested in academia and even research  uh  i enjoy what i do  but ive seen some awesome things that you can do if youi dont fault them for pursing a career in peer research  which is why i think its kind of interesting why id admire myself more if i were more interested in that field  but  ah  i think im qualified and i think ill bring a lot to the company  ii fit in well with the environment here  and  uh  its something that ive always wanted to do alright ,5.14580135722,1,im computer science biology major mit im junior im expect graduate june ahm im interested kinda research well practical application type biological research computational engineering involve sorry would like know alright would say situation present step occasion im afraid take lead project like example guess um one computer science project work group together one teammates wasnt work well wasnt afraid kind step take lead like hey get ta get do um kind happen multiple time guess um one organization camp kesem im actually exec board lot plan summer camp kid whose parent cancer lot time debate simply like exactly want get uh want whole camp know uh kinda go day day need plan whole schedule lot conflict everyone different idea team orient board although get normal hierarchal structure uh lot thing like simply like map board visualize day schedule plan u teens able come solution together would say good example one team come solution together um think id like interested academia even research uh enjoy ive see awesome thing youi dont fault purse career peer research think kind interesting id admire interested field ah think im qualify think ill bring lot company ii fit well environment uh something ive always want alright
pp10,	um  so  um  im a thirdyear student at massachusetts institute of technology  uh  my major is aerospace engineering and i  um my  my background is primarily in fluid mechanics and control  and so thats why im interviewing for this position um  and  um  the applications im primarily interested in are in rotorcraft  uh  design  and  uh  analysis and uh  um  and im really excited about what your company is doing 	um  so  yes i think i  i think that i i dont think that a leader is the first adjective id pull out to describe myself um  but i think its something that i definitely  a role i definitely step into  um  when  when the need arises or when  um  i think that its appropriate um  whether i seek that out  i think really depends on the context  but  um  i definitely see myself as someone who can act independently  uh  can make decisions independently  can act on those decisions  and  uh  can manage people in order  um  to get sort of positive results  	mmhmm ok  um  so  um so when i worked for  um  the computer science and artificial intelligence lab in freshman year  i  um  had  had an issue  um  with one of the students i was working with  um  um  and we had a disagreement about how to handle some part of the project um  it was  it was more of a mechanical issue about what direction we should take  um  and without getting too into details  i think  um  going back to the leadership issue  um  the way i  the way i handled this issue was  um  to sit down and address the issue very directly  um  and to have a frank conversation about what we both wanted  evaluate where we both were  and  uh  talk through the options and make a decision right there not letting an issue linger um  i think thats generally my style  	um  thats not a question ive been asked a lot i think there are a few things um  one that comes to mind immediately is my written communication skills um  i definitely know thats something that i need to work on and  um  would love the opportunity to improve on that 	so from what ive seen so far in the interview and visiting  um  im really excited about this position i think this is somewhere i would fit  where i would fit in a lot um  im really excited about what i would be doing and the people i would be working with  and  um  i would just love to sort of get my hands dirty and  um  i think im pretty wellequipped to do so and to contribute in doing so um  so id love that opportunity 	yeah thank you ,4.16198686326,0,um um im thirdyear student massachusetts institute technology uh major aerospace engineering um background primarily fluid mechanic control thats im interview position um um application im primarily interested rotorcraft uh design uh analysis uh um im really excited company um yes think think dont think leader first adjective id pull describe um think something definitely role definitely step um need arises um think appropriate um whether seek think really depend context um definitely see someone act independently uh make decision independently act decision uh manage people order um get sort positive result mmhmm ok um um work um computer science artificial intelligence lab freshman year um issue um one student work um um disagreement handle part project um mechanical issue direction take um without get detail think um go back leadership issue um way way handle issue um sit address issue directly um frank conversation want evaluate uh talk option make decision right let issue linger um think thats generally style um thats question ive ask lot think thing um one come mind immediately write communication skill um definitely know thats something need work um would love opportunity improve ive see far interview visit um im really excited position think somewhere would fit would fit lot um im really excite would people would work um would love sort get hand dirty um think im pretty wellequipped contribute um id love opportunity yeah thank
pp11,um so i am a student here at mit im a junior studying biology and management um  i am very interested in finance  specifically investment banking or consulting uh  ive taken a bunch of different management finance classes  as well as interned in business management uh ive also done laboratory research and im working in a small consulting firm part time as  as of now  so um  i think im a leader  i think i know how to command respect in certain situations um  i know how to work together on a team  i think thats very important  uh  especially in the positions that im working at i think working with a group of people  being able to encourage them  uh  to work towards a certain goal  uh  shows my leadership characteristics um i defiantly consider myself a team player i think a lot of the different internships and experiences ive had have forced me to work on a team um  specifically  uh  in the class that im taking right now  uh 5279 which is management communication  we are working on a team project together and we when deciding on our topic uh for the team project  we had a lot of different disagreements  a lot of people had different ideas  uh and i think i kind of forced people to look at what they were saying  versus just like splurting out ideas  focusing on how their idea would actually turn out in a presentation um  and so trying to get people to compromise  um  and in the end we ended up picking my idea  so uh  well  i think id like to be taller  that kind of thing laughs  but other than that  uh  i think i wish i was more outgoing in certain situations um  i think sometimes im more reserved  or in class  im a little hesitant to participate if im not sure im a hundred percent correct i think its kind of a mit mentality  everyone likes to be right all the time so i think  uh  i have less reser er  if i had less reservations  about like  answering questions  that would be great um  i think with my academic experience  as well as my internship experiences i have enough uh  past um  data now assessing quantitative work as well as communication skills and leadership experience  um  and i have a nice balance of skills going into the position and  i am a fast learner im willing to learn on the job  so i think the combination of all that would be good ,5.65383731953,1,um student mit im junior study biology management um interested finance specifically investment banking consult uh ive take bunch different management finance class well intern business management uh ive also do laboratory research im work small consulting firm part time um think im leader think know command respect certain situation um know work together team think thats important uh especially position im work think work group people able encourage uh work towards certain goal uh show leadership characteristic um defiantly consider team player think lot different internship experience ive force work team um specifically uh class im take right uh management communication work team project together decide topic uh team project lot different disagreement lot people different idea uh think kind forced people look say versus like splurting idea focus idea would actually turn presentation um try get people compromise um end end pick idea uh well think id like taller kind thing laugh uh think wish outgo certain situation um think sometimes im reserved class im little hesitant participate im sure im hundred percent correct think kind mit mentality everyone like right time think uh less reser er le reservation like answer question would great um think academic experience well internship experience enough uh past um data assess quantitative work well communication skill leadership experience um nice balance skill go position fast learner im willing learn job think combination would good
pp12,yea so  im a member clinical engineering student at mit  im a junior  um my main focus is in robotics and product design so im real interested in personal robotics and robotic side helps people on a daily basis um yea  i do think im a leader  umwhy im a leader  um i think that im very good at communicating with people and allowing people to be able to do something as a group together so somewhat facilitate in communication between others as well as communicating myself to others um and that way and also being able to motivate people and make sure they are on track with whatever they need to do in that way  um i think to some extent um people can look up to me in terms of you know  what ive done in the past with education or other  other things like that ok yea  so i do consider myself a team player  im currently in a robotics class right now thats a team project based and its me and 3 other students and we recently had to decide on a design for a robot and there is a little bit of not  not like total  you know  people not agreeing but there we had to decide between 2 main  2 different designs and theres a little bit of friction between 2 people versus 2 people of the 4 person team and we need to decide on the majority so um being a team player we were able to kind of mix the 2 designs to a certain extent so that we can all agree on one and i think by being a team leader or team player um  excuse me  i was able to compromise to some extent or give my ideas on how we can combine the two ah  i think if i could change one thing about myselfin terms like personality i assume you mean  um i probablythats a hard questionsi probably change the fact that i feel like i need to be constantly doing everything at once so i think sometimes i need to focus on one thing other than another cause i do have a really large variety of interest and i wish i had some way to not so id get rid of those interests  but recognize that i do need to focus out on one thing or one task at one time instead of doing everything at once ah  i think i could be really a beneficial part of adding to your company and it would give me a good opportunity to learn from the people that you guys have currently employed um so  if i was given that opportunity both learn from them but also that id give benefit to what you guys are doing i think would be great ,5.2092662769,1,yea im member clinical engineering student mit im junior um main focus robotics product design im real interested personal robotics robotic side help people daily basis um yea think im leader umwhy im leader um think im good communicating people allow people able something group together somewhat facilitate communication others well communicate others um way also able motivate people make sure track whatever need way um think extent um people look term know ive do past education thing like ok yea consider team player im currently robotics class right thats team project base student recently decide design robot little bit like total know people agree decide main different design theres little bit friction people versus people person team need decide majority um team player able kind mix design certain extent agree one think team leader team player um excuse able compromise extent give idea combine two ah think could change one thing myselfin term like personality assume mean um probablythats hard questionsi probably change fact feel like need constantly everything think sometimes need focus one thing another cause really large variety interest wish way id get rid interest recognize need focus one thing one task one time instead everything ah think could really beneficial part add company would give good opportunity learn people guy currently employ um give opportunity learn also id give benefit guy think would great
pp13,um  im a junior at mit studying electrical engineering and computer science uh  yes ive had several experiences where ive had to innovate and work with  take charge of a project and work with other people for instance  im part of the mit sae team  and basically its a club that builds a race car every year um  and  as of  so  we need a lot of money for sponsorship but  as of the end of last year  the website was pretty much defunct so  i decided to take over as webmaster and one of my  and  over the summer and the beginning of the school year i set up a new one thats nicely designed  and to get it up  i had to work with most of the other subteam leaders to get information that i needed for instance  the specs of the car  pictures of the car  different events for pr and things like that and  its done now  so its online now um so ah yes because uh  for instance  im also on the inaudible and  um  while i was working on designing the website i talked to several other people including the public relations chair about how to design and present ourselves on the website and  we disagreed about certain  uh  about the layout and things like that so to resolve the issue  we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to  we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people and  we also got opinions from several other team members um  one thing right now is that  i get hung up on small details on a project and  that could be an issue when im working on a big project  it can take too much time to focus on little things that dont matter too much in the big picture but  im working on changing that so since ive come to mit ive been involved in a lot of activities and a lot of classes  and this is forcing me to manage my time well so ive gotten better at focusing on the big picture of the project rather than small details that dont matter very much i have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done  and  im really interested in this position and i think i can learn and grow from it ,4.56058517871,0,um im junior mit study electrical engineering computer science uh yes ive several experience ive innovate work take charge project work people instance im part mit sae team basically club build race car every year um need lot money sponsorship end last year website pretty much defunct decide take webmaster one summer begin school year set new one thats nicely design get work subteam leader get information need instance spec car picture car different event pr thing like do online um ah yes uh instance im also inaudible um work design website talked several people include public relation chair design present website disagreed certain uh layout thing like resolve issue basically look website several successful team try basically compromise try emulate thing seem work well people also get opinion several team member um one thing right get hang small detail project could issue im work big project take much time focus little thing dont matter much big picture im work change since ive come mit ive involve lot activity lot class force manage time well ive gotten well focus big picture project rather small detail dont matter much quantitative qualitative skill solve problem get thing do im really interested position think learn grow
pp14,sure uh im a computer science student here and im currently a junior  but im planning on graduating early  so  uhm  im right now looking into either getting my masters degree or looking at full time jobs as well and balancing that  uh  in terms of what i enjoy in computer science  i really like front end stuff ive done a lot of web development i worked at google last summer  on google photos  the front end for that and  uh  yeah so i really like  eh  cconsumer facing products uh  well  i think i have a pretty engaging personality so im very expressive and im good at communicating things so i think  yknow  just that qualification in itself really lends m my  uh  myself to leadership but i think also  uh  as a technical person its  its e especially useful to have those skills because they are more rare so in that sense i do think im a leader  because i possess both  you know  technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well so the pairing of that really does lend itself well to leadership roles sure so  eh  whats so great about mit is that we actually do a lot of group projects that really encourage teamwork so  you know  a lot of the issues that maybe i didnt work out in high school  in terms of working on a team  ive gotten the chance to flesh out here and i do think that ive been able to grow  uhm  as someone working on a team so for example  in one of my classes  its a software design class  and we basically had to split up the work so that we could get this huge project done and one of the people on my team was just really not pulling her weight and so me and this other person noticed this and we were concerned but we all discussed it we sat down and discussed it and we realized just that the way we were allocating the work wasnt playing to her strengths  so we adjusted how we were allocating the work and then things worked out a lot better we were able to  you know  accomplish our goals and also more evenly divide the the work uhm  thats a hard question haha cuz im a pretty confident person so theres not a lot of things i dont often think about this i guess  i wish that  uhm  i wish i had the ability to  uh  i guess stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more  i think because i am very ambitious and i really enjoy life  im always going and moving and doing things  and i think theres times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatevers happening in your life uh  but  you know  im young  so i like to try a lot of new things and thats a consequence of that  mhmm uh  so i mentioned this before  but i think im qualified in a lot of respects  both technically and in my communication skills so thats just a balance that you dont see a lot  uh  especially in the computer science field so i think i can bring a lot to the table in terms of that  uh  in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people  but also my ability to understand  uh  technical concepts and especially working in a technical company thats incredibly important so i think i have a good balance of that and youre not going to find a lot of candidates like that ,5.90207890505,1,sure uh im computer science student im currently junior im plan graduate early im right look either get master degree look full time job well balance uh term enjoy computer science really like front end stuff ive do lot web development work google last summer google photo front end uh yeah really like eh cconsumer facing product uh well think pretty engage personality im expressive im good communicating thing think yknow qualification really lend uh leadership think also uh technical person e especially useful skill rare sense think im leader posse know technical skill also ability communicate really well pair really lend well leadership role sure eh whats great mit actually lot group project really encourage teamwork know lot issue maybe didnt work high school term work team ive gotten chance flesh think ive able grow someone work team example one class software design class basically split work could get huge project do one people team really pull weight person notice concerned discussed sat discuss realize way allocate work wasnt play strength adjust allocate work thing work lot well able know accomplish goal also evenly divide work thats hard question haha cuz im pretty confident person there lot thing dont often think guess wish wish ability uh guess stop enjoy moment little bit think ambitious really enjoy life im always go move thing think there time well relax enjoy whatevers happen life uh know im young like try lot new thing thats consequence mhmm uh mention think im qualify lot respect technically communication skill thats balance dont see lot uh especially computer science field think bring lot table term uh term leadership skills ability talk people also ability understand uh technical concept especially work technical company thats incredibly important think good balance youre go find lot candidate like
pp15,more about my background uh are we assuming that okay okay um all right um  so i guess ill start out with uh i decided to go to mit as my undergrad school  because i wanted a strong education in science and math and um mit i found would be one of the best places to develop my problemsolving skills and my uh quantmy quantitative skills  which is really valuable  i feel um for employers nowadays  and so i can certainly say that laugh its i have definitely got a lot better at  like  learning how to solve problems working with others  um and its also given me like a lot of opportunity  mit has given me a lot of opportunity to  you know  test out my leadership skills by having so many different student groups  um in particular um  ive like  i feel that um my position as the 2014 treasurer my freshman year was uh really critical in helping me develop um  you know  time management skills  interpersonal skills and communicating with like not only your like not only with like um people who are at  you know  adults who are older than you  and working with people in different offices  but also with  like  your peers um similarly  um in training students club  ive found um that where ive taken a leadership role as a cultural chair that  unlike in say  high school  you need to really spearhead um efforts to like throw large events yourself  and thats like its really given me um a feel of what its like to sort of  you know  take on the responsibility of like organizing an event mmhm  um  i think i def um im sorry i think that i am definitely a leader as ive  ive shared with you previously  i um have taken um positions with great responsibility in the student groups im involved in  and as well in my major  i uh am i am inv uh  im in biological engineering  and i think that ive taken a lot of initiative in finding  you know  ways to like test out the concepts i learn in class outside of class by finding uh research positions and later lab um where the weekly lab meetings has really helped me  you know  improve my communication skills with presenting information to an audience  mmhm okay um i think probably the best example um i definitely consider myself a team player i had to work in teamsin everything ive had to do so far  from academics to my work experience um in my startup internship my freshman year um and my corporate internship my sophomore year um everything was i had to learn how to um not only do the task that was given to me  but to also sort of be able to  you know  delegate tasks to who i was working with and carry out what was  what was asked of me  as well um last summer  i was a year  um i did an international year off in thailand  and my lab partner um was a graduate student who was older than me  but i was  we were partners on the project but we found that our levels of technical skill were really different it was her first time working in any sort of lab whereas i was more experienced so  that sort of created a strange dynamic between us  um because i had to  like  take the lead even though she was given more responsibility because more was expected from her  so i had to sort of help her out and get her up to speed with  with the project um  and i needed to do that in a way that didnt hurt our personal relationship because we also did have to  like  live together  being americans abroad  we really stayed together for most of it  so i felt that being just like really honest and transparent with her was um the best way um just to like say  what about you know say  you know  just like speak up about our frustrations  but also like to  to compliment on  like  the things that are done well i think thats what really helped  um so  one thing i wish i was better at was um you know speaking well when put on the spot laugh i tend to  when im nervous  i tend to  you know  not really focus on what im saying  because im trying not to mess up and in order to hide that  i also  you know  channel the stress in different ways  such as like looking around  perhaps a lot of intrusive movement with my hands or my body  um and also speaking  being longwinded and speaking too much in order to cover that up so  i think that just being more comfortable with speaking um in the higher pressure situation  such as public speaking  or in an interview laughs um is something that i would like to improve okay um so i think that i can bring like with the the my skills and experience is um someone who is really can work well under stress i may not talk well under stress laughs but i can work well under stress um i think my academic being um you know having the rigorous undergraduate curriculum at mit has made me really hone my time management skills um the other week i had to juggle um um  you know  throwing together a large event for a students club  um and have meetings with cultural chairs of the other clubs um ive also had to  at the same time there was a big event that my sorority was organizing that i also have to help contribute to  and  like  uh my  i had a friend whos also going through a tough time  so i had to  like  help her out that  and then complete school work and also  um  you know  just keep on the lookout  now that im a junior  theres a lot of like  you know  opportunities and needs  such as like fellowships  and then  like  programs of like ip  over the summer  that have  like  application deadlines coming up and just being able to balance all of that um and so far um i think that  like  my experiences um that i was able to be on top of all of those deadlines not only now  but  like  in the past  and i think that says a lot about um my ability to  you know  work hard and also  you know  balance out my lifestyle so um i think that this would be a huge asset at your company ,3.77148901234,0,background uh assume okay okay um right um guess ill start uh decide go mit undergrad school want strong education science math um mit find would one best place develop problemsolving skill uh quantmy quantitative skill really valuable feel um employer nowadays certainly say laugh definitely get lot well like learn solve problem work others um also give like lot opportunity mit give lot opportunity know test leadership skills many different student group um particular um ive like feel um position treasurer freshman year uh really critical help develop um know time management skill interpersonal skill communicate like like like um people know adult old work people different office also like peer um similarly um training student club ive find um ive take leadership role cultural chair unlike say high school need really spearhead um effort like throw large event thats like really give um feel like sort know take responsibility like organize event mmhm um think def um im sorry think definitely leader ive ive share previously um take um position great responsibility student group im involve well major uh inv uh im biological engineering think ive take lot initiative finding know way like test concept learn class outside class find uh research position later lab um weekly lab meeting really help know improve communication skill present information audience mmhm okay um think probably best example um definitely consider team player work teamsin everything ive far academics work experience um startup internship freshman year um corporate internship sophomore year um everything learn um task give also sort able know delegate task work carry ask well um last summer year um international year thailand lab partner um graduate student old partner project find level technical skill really different first time work sort lab whereas experience sort create strange dynamic u um like take lead even though give responsibility expect sort help get speed project um need way didnt hurt personal relationship also like live together american abroad really stay together felt like really honest transparent um best way um like say know say know like speak frustration also like compliment like thing do well think thats really help um one thing wish good um know speak well put spot laugh tend im nervous tend know really focus im say im try mess order hide also know channel stress different way like look around perhaps lot intrusive movement hand body um also speak longwinded speak much order cover think comfortable speak um high pressure situation public speak interview laugh um something would like improve okay um think bring like skill experience um someone really work well stress may talk well stress laugh work well stress um think academic um know rigorous undergraduate curriculum mit make really hone time management skill um week juggle um um know throw together large event student club um meeting cultural chair club um ive also time big event sorority organize also help contribute like uh friend who also go tough time like help complete school work also um know keep lookout im junior there lot like know opportunity need like fellowship like program like ip summer like application deadline come able balance um far um think like experience um able top deadline like past think say lot um ability know work hard also know balance lifestyle um think would huge asset company
pp16, umm  so im a junior at mit  umm studying economics  umm and planning on minoring in biology  perhaps concentrating in anthropology  umm  im interested in pursuing a degree in public health after  right after mit  umm and either waiting to do an md  or combining those two at the same time  umm  what im really interested is health care disparities  umm especially in  in the field of international health  umm specifically kind of doing uh cost evaluation of different health projects  umm working towards  uh figuring out how resources can best be allocated  and best be used to maximize efficiency  umm  and then here at mit im also involved in an organization called glommid  umm and we  what we do is were partnered with an organization in togo  umm and they work with hivaids patients there and they are the primary hivaid care provider  umm  outside of the public health system there  umm  and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year and then in the summer we go and implement a project there  umm  i think that definitely over the mit  my mit career  ive evolved more as a leader  umm  of the  umm actually the copresident of glommid  umm last year  so the club started last year  uh  but the presidents were not very invested in the club  umm  and what i learned from that was i guess  the experience was  taught me some things what leaders shouldnt be  but i think really ive learned whats effective as a leader so far  by doing things differently this semester  um  some of the things like even just the really little basic things seem to really have an impact  so for example  for our staff meetings which is the whole general body meeting  umm were sending  we send out a little doodle form beforehand and it kinda just has  you know what concerns do you have  umm do you feel like youre really involved  like umm  and theres also just a little section  like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week  and just having that  like interaction and then also we like follow up on any concerns  umm i think the members really have liked that  and so far compared to last year everyone like even the people who are just general body members not even like an exec are much more invested than some of the exec members last year and i think thats because we realized last year what we really were lacking  umm  like my current copresident realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project  we need to focus within ourselves first  umm  so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership  umm  yea ok  so  conflict  umm  well i guess ill use an example from last year for glommid  umm  so we were partnered with a different organization last year  and we  what  how it works is a national organization  theres fifty chapters  umm and we had a partner in laos  and all of a sudden last minute  they said we could no longer go and implement the project  so i was the person in charge of organizing the trip  that my role on exec  so that was really hard for me because i felt kind of betrayed kind of by the copresidents and by nationals umm  because the reason was because the laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their ngo status revoked since laos just started having ngos  so that was something i kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here  like laos is very not welcoming towards americans because of  past  and so  i felt really kind of let down by umm  by them  and i think everyone on the glommid team also felt really let down  because it was february  we had been fundraising all year  planning campaigns  umm and this  so what we did i think  umm  like i switched over to campaigns coordinator and i still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them  because it wasnt because they were a bad organization that we couldnt go  it was because that the government wouldnt allow it  and we didnt want to risk them losing their ngo status for a project  umm  so what  i  went through the campaign  i tried to get people to focus more  just remember what our partner does  why we are doing this  umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization  umm  and then through this summer  and through this fall ive been trying to keep in contact with our partner  our old partner  although we are repartnered now  umm  to see how our  the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about whats going on  so that it doesnt feel like last year was a complete failure  yea  oh  thats a tough question  umm  i think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings  umm  and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation  so i think  ive definitely  and this is something ive been working on to be more proactive and in larger group situations  but for example like big lectures  asking questions or things like that i usually try and avoid  but ive been trying to push myself to become more vocal  uh  i think i should get the job because i think what my assets are i combine econ and health  which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination  and ive done  ive taken a lot of classes  im involved in a national development  both from the technical side of econ  the anthropological and the health side  and also my involvement in glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that i dont think necessarily come through a class ,4.23095320879,0,im junior mit study economics plan minoring biology perhaps concentrate anthropology im interested pursue degree public health right mit either wait md combine two time im really interested health care disparity especially field international health specifically kind uh cost evaluation different health project work towards uh figure resource best allocate best use maximize efficiency mit im also involved organization call glommid partner organization togo work hivaids patient primary hivaid care provider outside public health system fundraise throughout year summer go implement project think definitely mit mit career ive evolve leader actually copresident glommid last year club start last year uh president invest club learn guess experience teach thing leader shouldnt think really ive learn whats effective leader far thing differently semester um thing like even really little basic thing seem really impact example staff meeting whole general body meeting send send little doodle form beforehand kinda know concern feel like youre really involve like there also little section like kudos someone great job week like interaction also like follow concern think member really like far compare last year everyone like even people general body member even like exec much invest exec member last year think thats realize last year really lack like current copresident realize lack really sense community order effective really establish strong relationship partner fundraise really come strong project need focus within first experience definitely teach lot leadership yea ok conflict well guess ill use example last year glommid partner different organization last year work national organization there fifty chapter partner laos sudden last minute say could longer go implement project person charge organize trip role exec really hard felt kind betray kind copresidents national reason laotian government would see u volunteer tourism could get ngo status revoke since lao start ngos something kind unsure like sure go like lao welcome towards american past felt really kind let think everyone glommid team also felt really let february fundraise year planning campaign think like switched campaign coordinator still like tried keep everyone invest excite campaign still fundraise wasnt bad organization couldnt go government wouldnt allow didnt want risk lose ngo status project go campaign try get people focus remember partner focus much kind miscommunication happen national partner organization summer fall ive try keep contact partner old partner although repartnered see money raise like project go try keep people informed whats go doesnt feel like last year complete failure yea oh thats tough question think sometimes lack bit confidence big group setting usually take little bit get comfortable situation think ive definitely something ive work proactive large group situation example like big lecture ask question thing like usually try avoid ive try push become vocal uh think get job think asset combine econ health kind rare undergraduate combination ive do ive take lot class im involve national development technical side econ anthropological health side also involvement glommid also teach lot reality international health international development dont think necessarily come class
pp17,been all right schools uh  you know  its always that time in the middle of the semester yeah its nuts um yes so i am a junior here at mit in computer science and engineering um and most of my experience here has been actually at the game lab on campus so ive worked there for the past few years and ive worked on many different kinds of projects in various languages and with different people um and uh also uh ive taken courses here in algorithms  uh in graphics  uh also software construction but ive really found algorithms to be something that im really interested in  i think theyre really beautiful and elegant  they can accomplish a lot and in my spare time i like to um do yoga  im not very good at it  and i love food so finding hidden gems in the city is really fun uh yes i am so um last semester here at mit i took  as i mentioned  a software construction class and um in this class we had you know quite a few projects and some of these were group projects so the first group project that we had in the class  um i was working with uh two of my peers they seemed um like nice people and all but we were having issues um you know actually getting things done getting a time when we could all meet and um you know that sort of thing so uh it looked like no one was really stepping up so i decided to step up and um i made sure to contact everyone in the group and um you know got us working together um and we met up and you know i made sure that we were always on task and took notes on what we were doing um so that when it came to actually implementing our ideas that we actually had some sort of structure and our project turned out really great uh at the end there was a bit of a time crunch but all in all i think we worked together really well and im very pleased with how it turned out i do consider myself a team player um worked on many teams so in this same software construction class ironically the second group project which was our final project for the course did not go quite as planned so i was working with two other people and uh in this case i tried to get us working together and tried to do my part for our project but uh they were not having it and um they actually ended up overwriting my code multiple times instead of you know allowing me to contribute to the project um even after i spoke to them about it and told them there were tools um that could help resolve conflicts in the code and they just werent cooperating um and so i ended up having to go talk to my ta and talking to my course administrator here and also to the student support services to see you know what  how i could resolves the situation because i had done everything that i thought i could um so that turned out okay at the end but sometimes things are out of your control and i think those are the hardest problems to confront but um you know uh its okay to ask for help sometimes i think that it ended up okay in the end ooh  thats a toughie hmm i think  if i had one thing i could change it would probably be being more aggressive  which aggressive is a scary word perhaps so um perhaps being more assertive ive always been a pretty quiet person um even when i was growing up and this is something that like in elementary school my teachers would say that  oh you know on my progress reports  stephie is a very quiet and sweet girl but they didnt really have anything else to say because i was so quiet um and you know even now sometimes being around people can make me nervous and this is something that ive been working on um you know over you know since i can remember i guess and as of late ive been trying to take a more active role in you know overcoming my fear of people uh i uh a few years ago worked at a starbucks for about a year yeah back in  this was in downtown boston in the financial district  so of all the customers you could possibly have at a starbucks  these were the probably the most challenging ones that you could have so after working there and dealing with these people i feel like i can pretty much you know  i can deal with anyone even if it makes me sort of nervous um you know ive been there so i can sort of take my experiences form there and apply them to what i encounter nowadays hm  well uh i have a lot of experience uh working at the game lab here and that coupled with you know what ive learned in classes i think makes me a really good fit for this job i have  um so when i was working at the game lab i worked on many  many projects so pretty much one project a semester and these projects varied widely they were in different languages  the topics were different some were more technical  some werent some were more fully specified than others and so given that ive touched upon such a wide range of things  i think that im very adaptable uh and also um at this game lab  ive worked in lots of teams  so i feel like i have a strong grasp of teamwork and having worked at that starbucks  ive really learned to deal with all sorts of people so i feel like thats a good asset to have for this job ,4.92906556617,1,right school uh know always time middle semester yeah nut um yes junior mit computer science engineering um experience actually game lab campus ive work past year ive work many different kind project various language different people um uh also uh ive take course algorithms uh graphic uh also software construction ive really find algorithm something im really interested think theyre really beautiful elegant accomplish lot spare time like um yoga im good love food find hidden gem city really fun uh yes um last semester mit take mention software construction class um class know quite project group project first group project class um work uh two peer seem um like nice people issue um know actually get thing do get time could meet um know sort thing uh look like one really step decide step um make sure contact everyone group um know get u work together um met know make sure always task take note um come actually implement idea actually sort structure project turn really great uh end bit time crunch think work together really well im pleased turn consider team player um work many team software construction class ironically second group project final project course go quite plan work two people uh case try get u work together tried part project uh um actually end overwrite code multiple time instead know allow contribute project um even speak told tool um could help resolve conflict code werent cooperate um end go talk ta talk course administrator also student support service see know could resolve situation do everything thought could um turn okay end sometimes thing control think hard problem confront um know uh okay ask help sometimes think end okay end ooh thats toughie hmm think one thing could change would probably aggressive aggressive scary word perhaps um perhaps assertive ive always pretty quiet person um even grow something like elementary school teacher would say oh know progress report stephie quiet sweet girl didnt really anything else say quiet um know even sometimes around people make nervous something ive work um know know since remember guess late ive try take active role know overcome fear people uh uh year ago work starbucks year yeah back downtown boston financial district customer could possibly starbucks probably challenge one could work deal people feel like pretty much know deal anyone even make sort nervous um know ive sort take experience form apply encounter nowadays hm well uh lot experience uh work game lab couple know ive learned class think make really good fit job um working game lab work many many project pretty much one project semester project vary widely different language topic different technical werent fully specify others give ive touch upon wide range thing think im adaptable uh also um game lab ive work lots team feel like strong grasp teamwork work starbucks ive really learned deal sort people feel like thats good asset job
pp20,ok  um this is separate from the other time  right ok laughs  um  im a junior  um  at mit studying environmental engineering um  im originally from minnesota um  im taking classes this semester in hydrology and environmental transport and i found them really interesting  and i thought that they would apply to this job  um  yeah laughs um  yeah  i think ive stepped up to a lot of leaderslip  ship positions since i came to college im president of my living group  um   im also on the rowing team and i feel like ive  um  played a leadership role there  um um  so  as president of my living group  um  i lead house meetings every other week  and i also am involved in resolving problems between people  um  so theres like several different conditions in the house which control  like  say for instance  like  buying food  or like  maintaining the house and i help coordinate everybody and make sure they can work together  mmmhmm umm yeah umm  let me think i guess something thats come up in my living group  i was house manager last semester  and so  as part of our living group  people have to do  like  weekly house jobs so like  kind of chores  and so weve definitely had conflicts over  like  people who arent pulling their weight in the house  and there were times i had to step in and take the person aside and let them know that they were adversely affecting the group and that there were  like  consequences if they didnt  um   end up  you know  pulling more weight  and i definitely had success with that and  um  one particular instance i talked to someone and she came back to the next house meeting and apologized to the group  and  definitely started to change her behavior um i dont i dont think theres anything i would necessarily change about myself i feel like the experiences ive had have  like  taught me different things and  um  theres definitely things im working on growing in but theyre things that  like  i dont think theyre things i would expect to change overnight  necessarily um  im working on being more outgoing  so  like i said  ive stepped up  both on the crew team and as part of my living group  into leadership roles  and so i think thats changed a lot in the last couple of years and is still changing  um  i think i have a lot of experience  um  with the classes ive taken and with previous internship opportunities um  i did an internship at an environment restoration company after my freshman year which i think helped prepare me um  im also really excited about going into this field  um  i havent  b  had the chance to apply the things ive learned in my classes yet and i think this would be a really good opportunity for me to apply those things  so i think i would be able to help the company out in that way ,3.89837257493,0,ok um separate time right ok laugh um im junior um mit study environmental engineering um im originally minnesota um im take class semester hydrology environmental transport find really interesting thought would apply job um yeah laugh um yeah think ive step lot leaderslip ship position since come college im president live group um im also row team feel like ive um play leadership role um um president live group um lead house meeting every week also involve resolve problem people um there like several different condition house control like say instance like buy food like maintain house help coordinate everybody make sure work together mmmhmm yeah let think guess something thats come live group house manager last semester part live group people like weekly house job like kind chore weve definitely conflict like people arent pull weight house time step take person aside let know adversely affect group like consequence didnt um end know pull weight definitely success um one particular instance talk someone come back next house meeting apologize group definitely start change behavior um dont dont think there anything would necessarily change feel like experience ive like taught different thing um there definitely thing im work grow theyre thing like dont think theyre thing would expect change overnight necessarily um im work outgo like say ive step crew team part live group leadership roles think thats change lot last couple year still change um think lot experience um class ive take previous internship opportunity um internship environment restoration company freshman year think help prepare um im also really excited go field um havent b chance apply thing ive learn class yet think would really good opportunity apply thing think would able help company way
pp21,okayso uh i grew up in tampa  florida uhm from paretns of chineseamerican decent or theyre from china and im chinese american and uhm thoughout my uhm high school career i actually uh taking biology classes cuz i had a really good teacher who like really made uh this subject material engaging uhm and then here in mit i uhm i first started out as course 20 which us uh biological engineering and then i took my first programming class and i really liked it  its like uhm i think it sort of matches uhm how i think like telling a computer how to uh do things in a precise way and so thats why i switched to uh course 67 hmmm mmm uhm i think that im a leader in the sense that like oh lets say that theres a thing that needs to get done then i will make sure that it does get done like uh for example at uh the tac which is mit student newspaper uhm every week uhm you have to uh of course like edit things and when the previous uhm campus life editor wanted to move on to a different department i stepped up and got it done uhm yeah uhm so i guess when uhm i havent had a super large amount of time to uh experience doing like really large team projects i imagine ill get more experience in that as i get into like more project based classes uhm i guess i would uh im okay with working with other people as long as uh theres like clear communication and like people are responsible like uhm doing the task that theyre supposed to be doing i guess i would be good working with a team other like responsible people that make sure like youre doing your portion of the job because i would want to make sure i am also doing my portion of the job and like if everybody like does their part then i think that i would be happy working with them hmmm well actually statistically i think that i would like to be a little but taller because actually its true i believe that like taller people are more like uhm they get better like jobs and like theyre statistically more likely to succeed just because youre more impressed by a taller person so its like well sure why not it would i think it would make it might have some percentage chance of making my life better also if i maybe theres like another second thing changing my last name to something that starts with a because thats also showing statistically increase your chances of success uhm same company okay uhm so i think i hope that uh i have so i would obviously really love working for google and i would and uhm my skills as being responsible  communicating clearly  my uh computer science skills i learned at mit i hope will bring uh a lot of value to this position and i also really uh would i hope to embody googles principles of like uh making really innovative software and like to build to delivering really good customer experiences uhm and i hope that uh they will uh i hope you will also find my contributions you can find my uh contributions useful ,4.95088370379,1,okayso uh grow tampa florida paretns chineseamerican decent theyre china im chinese american thoughout high school career actually uh take biology class cuz really good teacher like really make uh subject material engage mit first start course u uh biological engineering take first program class really like like think sort match think like tell computer uh thing precise way thats switch uh course hmmm mmm think im leader sense like oh let say there thing need get do make sure get do like uh example uh tac mit student newspaper every week uh course like edit thing previous campus life editor want move different department step get do yeah guess havent super large amount time uh experience like really large team project imagine ill get experience get like project base class guess would uh im okay work people long uh there like clear communication like people responsible like task theyre suppose guess would good work team like responsible people make sure like youre portion job would want make sure also portion job like everybody like part think would happy work hmmm well actually statistically think would like little taller actually true believe like taller people like get good like job like theyre statistically likely succeed youre impressed taller person like well sure would think would make might percentage chance make life well also maybe theres like another second thing change last name something start thats also show statistically increase chance success company okay think hope uh would obviously really love work google would skills responsible communicate clearly uh computer science skill learn mit hope bring uh lot value position also really uh would hope embody google principle like uh make really innovative software like build deliver really good customer experience hope uh uh hope also find contribution find uh contribution useful
pp22,im a junior in aerospace engineering im originally from kansas city  born in maryland and im interested in consulting because im currently trying to decide between going into aerospace engineering and going into consulting and one of the things that appeals to me about consulting is that i like the idea of working on different projects and not being stuck doing the same thing all the time and thats something that is very prevalent in engineering and is very traditional about the engineering field and  as far as hobbies that i enjoy i am interested in global development  international development and poverty related issues as well as music i play cello and am involved with the chamber music society at mit yes  i definitely do think im a leader um  one of the global poverty  er  one of the organizations im involved with on campus is the global poverty initiative and im currently their director of action and what that means is im leading a student group of about twenty people and  um  under the action branch of the whole organization  and what we do is  in the action branch  is work on projects on a global scale so  we have projects currently in india and projects in mexico and my job is to coordinate these projects and work on what communities we want to go work in and what types of technology related projects wed like to pursue and ive been involved with this organization for two and a half years now  and have been the director of action for the past two years i definitely do consider myself a team player um  one time that we experienced some conflict in one of the teams i was working on was actually in one of my aerospace engineering classes in this team  our job was to build an rc airplane  design  build and fly it and we hit some conflicts within our team because  it was mostly everyone was very busy  everyone was very stressed it was towards the end of the year when everyones preparing for finals and it was just a very highstrung environment  and the projects was very involved it involved machining  it involved design work  and coordination between a team of four and what ended up happening was  well  we needed to get in and find the time to actually work on our airplane and build it whereas all of us were involved in student groups and had a very heavy courseload and conflict did arise and how we ended up solving this was we  we all decided that something needed to change and we realized that we werent putting together quality work when we were doing two people at a time or two people coming in or someone cancelling at the last minute  things like that we ended up just having to sit down  lay it all out  discuss whatever we needed to do to make sure that were all here  were all committing the right amount of time towards this project and  honestly it was just very much a group effort and we all sat down and individually realized that we needed to prioritize and i needed to put my classes above some of my interests and my hobbies and that was something that we all decided to do as a group one thing about myself being more on top of my work something that i definitely need for myself is a deadline and ive always been like that if you dont give me a deadline sometimes ill end up dragging my feet  and things get done at the last minute and its just disorganization and so ive been trying to deal with that by making my own small deadlines  personal deadlines  writing them down  making lists and making sure that i prioritize things in advance but thats something that has taken me probably two years at mit to learn how to do  and im finally getting it i think i should get the job because i have a very interesting background  and i believe that i have very unique experiences that could add a lot to your organization as someone with an engineering background but  as well as a management background because i am minoring in management at mit and i think that combination adds a lot to the environment that you would like to have at your company i think putting a lot of people together in one environment trying to work on the same projects with the same background is something that is very limiting and i believe that i could add quite a bit of diversity and unique perspective to your team ,5.34692631635,1,im junior aerospace engineering im originally kansas city bear maryland im interested consulting im currently try decide go aerospace engineering go consult one thing appeal consult like idea work different project stick thing time thats something prevalent engineering traditional engineering field far hobbies enjoy interested global development international development poverty related issue well music play cello involve chamber music society mit yes definitely think im leader um one global poverty er one organization im involve campus global poverty initiative im currently director action mean im lead student group twenty people um action branch whole organization action branch work project global scale project currently india project mexico job coordinate project work community want go work type technology relate project wed like pursue ive involve organization two half year director action past two year definitely consider team player um one time experience conflict one team work actually one aerospace engineering class team job build rc airplane design build fly hit conflict within team mostly everyone busy everyone stress towards end year everyones prepare final highstrung environment project involve involved machining involve design work coordination team four end happen well need get find time actually work airplane build whereas u involved student group heavy courseload conflict arise end solve decide something need change realize werent put together quality work two people time two people come someone cancel last minute thing like end sit lay discuss whatever need make sure commit right amount time towards project honestly much group effort sit individually realize need prioritize need put class interest hobby something decide group one thing top work something definitely need deadline ive always like dont give deadline sometimes ill end drag foot thing get do last minute disorganization ive try deal make small deadline personal deadline write make list make sure prioritize thing advance thats something take probably two year mit learn im finally get think get job interest background believe unique experience could add lot organization someone engineering background well management background minoring management mit think combination add lot environment would like company think put lot people together one environment try work project background something limit believe could add quite bit diversity unique perspective team
pp24,sure  so im currently a junior at mit i grew up outside of the city in a suburb called naydec ive danced my whole life and continued to do so at mit and im studying biology currently and for my humanities concentration  concentrating on spanish i would say definitely in various aspects of my life i try to step up as a leader im currently involved in an internship through hello at mit and so the point of the internship is to act as a peer network engagement intern so basically  reaching out to other jewish students at mit  who may not be looking for a very religious atmosphere but would just like to know that there are other jewish students that they could connect with and so my role as the leader of the situation is to connect various students who have similar interests either in community service or things like that and sort of set up a network for them  sure  i definitely hope that im a team player i think its definitely important to have leadership qualities but also to be able to mesh well within a group i think this comes out a lot in lab settings where everyone from undergraduate students to phd candidates and post docs really have to work together on similar projects and so being able to voice your opinions or your concerns about experiments while still taking the feedback from others  and making it more of a group effort than a hierarchy  i would say would be crucial i think  if i could change one thing it would probably be to have a little bit more self confidence i think i externally try to project a calm and outgoing personality  but inside i can tend to be a little bit shyer and so i think just being able to walk into any kind of either social or business related situation and really have that confidence without having to second guess myself would help move along both career wise and just with relationships with other people  i think coming with a background from mit would definitely help me out in this job the biology department at mit is really unique in its focus on research and so i think coming into this lab setting with that background would make a strong candidate ,5.72629711152,1,sure im currently junior mit grow outside city suburb call naydec ive dance whole life continue mit im study biology currently humanities concentration concentrate spanish would say definitely various aspect life try step leader im currently involve internship hello mit point internship act peer network engagement intern basically reach jewish student mit may look religious atmosphere would like know jewish student could connect role leader situation connect various student similar interest either community service thing like sort set network sure definitely hope im team player think definitely important leadership quality also able mesh well within group think come lot lab setting everyone undergraduate student phd candidate post doc really work together similar project able voice opinion concern experiment still take feedback others make group effort hierarchy would say would crucial think could change one thing would probably little bit self confidence think externally try project calm outgo personality inside tend little bit shy think able walk kind either social business relate situation really confidence without second guess would help move along career wise relationship people think come background mit would definitely help job biology department mit really unique focus research think come lab set background would make strong candidate
pp25,im good  how are you um  yeah i am  wait sorry  am i  ok  um im kathleen  im a core 16 major here at mitu  thats um aeronautical and astronautical engineering  if youre not familiar with our numbering system um  so ive been taking a lot of classes in aeronautical and astronautical engineering including some um propulsion classes  um uh principals of automatic control  um dynamics  aerodynamics  um computer engineering  so i am familiar with job and mat lab  um  and then also within those classes ive done some lab work um  including work on um a remote control airplane um  which we did for a competition last spring um  it was in teams of three um  my team  and the the goal is to maximize the ratio of the um the turn rate times the pay turn rate squared times the pay load um  my team worked really hard on that um and uh we ended up coming in second  um which was exciting  a little bit disappointing but laughter still it was still a really fun project that we worked on um  and then also done internships with  um my most recent one was with nasa glenn research center  um and i worked on two projects for that um  one was a venus rover conceptual design um  which was where we were trying to basically just figure out what the feesability would be for a small low cost rover on venus  um that would be able to fit within the budget of a discovery class mission um  and then  so that one was mostly  um there was a lot of research  a lot of um  pulling the other information from different areas  kind of because its not really a thing that people have looked at very closely before theres not a lot of information on the topic of how things perform in uh 450 degrees c in 90 atmospheres of pressure its kind of a specific thing um  so it was um a lot of just like trying to figure out  like what would work  what wouldnt work um  a lot of flexibility in the designs since it was in early stages  um and a lot of  um theres some  some mat lab you know and analysis and um coding involved with that to um  then the second project that we worked on for that internship was um an autonomous navigation system for small payloads um and that was an intern team project there was totally designed and run by me and a group of seven other interns um  so that was outside of work hours we were putting together  um it was uh steerable inaudible parachute  um  attached to a payload of about two or three pounds  um and i was in charge of testing and designing the  the parachute for that  um so that was  that was the second main project that we worked on um  yes i do think im a leader um  and i think that ive shown that through my work on my projects um  being willing to  to make decisions  take chances with something um that may or may not work  but its wi   its important to be able to try things to figure out if thats gonna be the case or not um and i think that  uh especially like in the  the venus rover and um also with the dropson project  um since those were two projects where there werent a lot of uh specific design constraints imposed on us from the start  it was really important to just  um to just take an idea and run with it run the equations  um drop it off a building  in the case of the dropson  laughter um and just see what happened  um so that was something that i got to be pretty comfortable with doing uh  yes and yes laughter um  i need a  so especially with the intern team project  when there were eight of us involved in this team  um and that was a kind of unique experience in that there was really no like hierarchy of um control or anything it was just eight interns and we were all on equal footing all had pretty equal experience and backgrounds  um so there wasnt really anyone who was specifically in charge of that project  um and that involved a lot of give and take um and so  i think one of the biggest uh conflicts we faced as a team was when we were just deciding  at the very beginning what our project was going to be  um and this was going to be something that was gonna uh be a pretty significant part of the next ten weeks of our summer so it was pretty important for us to choose something that was gonna  was gonna go well um  so the it ended up being a uh fairly difficult decision between the uh a design project for uh a small reentry vehicle versus the autonomous navigation system that we did um  and how we handled it um was we just kind of  we all came together and had um a round table sort of a discussion um  we implemented hand raising uh rules and um so as to make sure that people had equal talking time um  and then we  after we had talked for several hours  um making sure that most of the important things that needed to be said would get said  um we  we just voted on it um with secret ballet  wrote down what our decision  what decision we wanted  um we counted up the votes and then we just went with that decision um and i think that um  for me and for the other interns on the team as well  it was really important that everyone recognize that whatever the outcome of the vote was  was thats what we were gonna do um and we would all get on board with that project right away um and thats what happened  um and there wasnt any like uh  real i dont know bitterness or resentment about doing the project that we did i think it pretty well um i would make it so that i was more organized i often struggle to meet deadlines  when i have a lot of them piled together not because the work is hard  but because i just forget that the deadlines are coming um  so i think that thats something that i could really work on um and i have been working on that laughter um by keeping notebooks and writing down uh schedules of important dates  um asking friends to help me out if i know that theres something were working on together and its at the deadline or just an assignment that we both have and theres a deadline asking for a reminder um from my more talented friends  um and keeping my google calendar up to date as well has been helping with that um i think i should get this job because i am uh i am well qualified for it ive done projects that are um  they are in the same type of area and i think that my experiences from them will really carry over so i can contribute to this job um and uh i think that i can also  um i mean ive also shown that im  i am a team player and a leader so i think that as well as my technical expertise  i think that uh my personality fits in well with this job and i really like the environment as well that ive seen um um um  employees it seems like theres a lot of enthusiasm for work um and i think that i would fit in well with that ,5.12695700394,1,im good um yeah wait sorry ok um im kathleen im core major mitu thats um aeronautical astronautical engineering youre familiar numbering system um ive taking lot class aeronautical astronautical engineering include um propulsion class um uh principal automatic control um dynamic aerodynamics um computer engineering familiar job mat lab um also within class ive do lab work um include work um remote control airplane um competition last spring um team three um team goal maximize ratio um turn rate time pay turn rate square time pay load um team work really hard um uh end come second um excite little bit disappointing laughter still still really fun project work um also do internship um recent one nasa glenn research center um work two project um one venus rover conceptual design um try basically figure feesability would small low cost rover venus um would able fit within budget discovery class mission um one mostly um lot research lot um pull information different area kind really thing people look closely theres lot information topic thing perform uh degree c atmospheres pressure kind specific thing um um lot like try figure like would work wouldnt work um lot flexibility design since early stage um lot um there mat lab know analysis um cod involved um second project work internship um autonomous navigation system small payload um intern team project totally design run group seven intern um outside work hour put together um uh steerable inaudible parachute um attach payload two three pound um charge test design parachute um second main project work um yes think im leader um think ive show work project um willing make decision take chance something um may may work wi important able try thing figure thats gon na case um think uh especially like venus rover um also dropson project um since two project werent lot uh specific design constraint impose u start really important um take idea run run equations um drop building case dropson laughter um see happen um something get pretty comfortable uh yes yes laughter um need especially intern team project eight u involve team um kind unique experience really like hierarchy um control anything eight intern equal footing pretty equal experience background um wasnt really anyone specifically charge project um involve lot give take um think one big uh conflict face team decide begin project go um go something gon na uh pretty significant part next ten week summer pretty important u choose something gon na gon na go well um end uh fairly difficult decision uh design project uh small reentry vehicle versus autonomous navigation system um handle um kind come together um round table sort discussion um implement hand raise uh rule um make sure people equal talk time um talk several hour um make sure important thing need say would get say um vote um secret ballet write decision decision want um count vote go decision um think um intern team well really important everyone recognize whatever outcome vote thats gon na um would get board project right away um thats happen um wasnt like uh real dont know bitterness resentment project think pretty well um would make organize often struggle meet deadline lot pile together work hard forget deadline come um think thats something could really work um work laughter um keep notebooks write uh schedule important date um ask friend help know there something work together deadline assignment there deadline ask reminder um talented friend um keep google calendar date well help um think get job uh well qualified ive do project um type area think experience really carry contribute job um uh think also um mean ive also show im team player leader think well technical expertise think uh personality fit well job really like environment well ive see um um um employee seem like there lot enthusiasm work um think would fit well
pp27,im doing well  thank you um so im a junwaitsorry  i dont im sorry i just  uh im just confused about  like  are weare we going like the same thing last time or do i need to introduce myself again like okay  okay  i got confused cause you said tell me more okay  sorry  okay  i was like waitam i supposed tookay  sorry um so i am a junior at mit studying chemistry and biology im primarily interested in how small molecules interact with biological systems such as um the effects of drugs or uh toxins or other uh metabolites on the body and its cells  ive done research since uh like coming to mit at in the lab of professor sounds like jonessiben in chemistry and biological engineering ive been looking at the mechanism of a drug that is currently in phase two clinical trials um for treatment of hiv umm in addition i have also done organic synthesis to develop um spacers for drug delivery um at the curie institute in paris  i think i am a leader ive done work in my dorm house government as dining chair and environmental chair to take a leadership role um and help residents to um express their concerns with the dining plan  um and to make changes to help make the residential experience um better for them  i definitely consider myself a team player ive uh done a lot of work in teams in my chemistry and undergraduate labs uh  we were often working in groups of like two or three um  there have been conflicts in those situations where um its difficultlike if a team member uh messes up something or even uh before that if team members come to the team with different lab experience due to their research background or classes theyve taken before  trying to figure out how to balance it so everyone gets to exum do the lab and have hands on experience while at the same time making sure that things go smoothly and that we work in an efficient manor um so itsit can be difficult to balance these things such that everyone gets a faium a fair chance at doing the handson component but we generally resolve this by taking turns and the people who are more experienced kind of uh  you know  supervise in almost a mentorlike way the person who has less experience  i wouldif i could change one thing about myself it would be to luh to be able to let go of things that have happened and like negative things that have happened more easily because i find that sometimes i can dwell on negative things that have happened and it causes me to worry a lot about the future and become very anxious or to hinder what i want to do in the future like being concernedyou knbeing so worried about performance in a class after not doing well on an exam that i get stressed out for the next exam and that can create like a negative cycle so if i could change one thing it would be learning how to put bad things behind me and move ahead its something ive definitely been working on  and having to work on since i can to mit where you get used to  you know  a lot of things  not have negative things happen but learning to push through that  i think i should get the job because i have experience from myfrom my course work which is very rigorous at mit in addition to my practical experience with research which has taught me what the research process is like  how to ask questions  how to work independently  and to preuh to present results and interpret them umm and thats good skills  i think for the work place  ,5.13232208775,1,im well thank um im junwaitsorry dont im sorry uh im confuse like weare go like thing last time need introduce like okay okay get confused cause say tell okay sorry okay like waitam suppose tookay sorry um junior mit study chemistry biology im primarily interested small molecule interact biological system um effect drug uh toxin uh metabolite body cell ive do research since uh like come mit lab professor sound like jonessiben chemistry biological engineering ive look mechanism drug currently phase two clinical trial um treatment hiv addition also do organic synthesis develop um spacers drug delivery um curie institute paris think leader ive do work dorm house government din chair environmental chair take leadership role um help resident um express concern din plan um make change help make residential experience um well definitely consider team player ive uh do lot work team chemistry undergraduate lab uh often work group like two three um conflict situation um difficultlike team member uh mess something even uh team member come team different lab experience due research background class theyve take try figure balance everyone get exum lab hand experience time make sure thing go smoothly work efficient manor um itsit difficult balance thing everyone get faium fair chance handson component generally resolve take turn people experience kind uh know supervise almost mentorlike way person less experience wouldif could change one thing would luh able let go thing happen like negative thing happen easily find sometimes dwell negative thing happen cause worry lot future become anxious hinder want future like concernedyou knbeing worried performance class well exam get stressed next exam create like negative cycle could change one thing would learn put bad thing behind move ahead something ive definitely work work since mit get use know lot thing negative thing happen learn push think get job experience myfrom course work rigorous mit addition practical experience research teach research process like ask question work independently preuh present result interpret thats good skill think work place
pp29,im doing pretty well  how are you um  so as far as my technical experience background goes um ive worked in three different labs um the summer after my freshman year i worked in a lab through um through mgh and located in charleston i worked with a harvard graduate student on her phd thesis which involved a lot of genetics and i did a lot of like very routine lab work um and that was just for the summer  and then the next  um my softmore year i worked in a lab here at mit  um the engelward laboratory that works with dna damage and i worked on an essay that quantified dna damage using um electrophoresis which was nice because i got to learn a lot of um different laboratory techniques and because im still currently working there ive had the time to delve into the project a little bit more have a deeper understanding than i was initially um and it also incorporates um components of coding like we use the math lab area um to um generate our data  so its been really interesting for me um and also this past summer i worked in a laboratory in israel  which was really interesting they worked with all sorts of biosensors um so its a pretty broad um field that they worked in and i got to work on my own project ive never had that type of independent freedom which was really exciting for me um and i think what i got more out of that was that just getting used to such a different work place and being able to acclimate myself and um be productive in that sort of environment  so um  i think im definitely a leader  i am willing to take charge of a situation um in a group of people im not afraid to stand  out or have my opinions heard um and on the flipside im not afraid to suffer consequences if uh theres any sort of negative outcome or negative or positive outcome im willing to handle um the results um  i think im a team player because  im willing to agree to others peoples um ideas um the question was a  what was  sorry could you repeat the  conflict in my team okay um so i in my sorority im on the executive board theres 10 of us and were lke in charge of the chapter and so um weve just all been newly elected to or positions so were kind of going through the process of working out exactly what our goal is and recently one of the topics have been like how to handle um judiciary issues like within our chapter and i have like very strong feelings on the subject as do other of my sisters and so being able to kind of handle that and be very professional and try to be unbiased because um i have like close relations with like other sisters in the chapter has been um a challenge and i think being able to remove myself emotionally from the situation and kind of listen to what the other people are saying and acknowledge that has been really  one of the like  biggest steps ive taken into kind of overcoming those kinds of challenges um  think  all i can think is like superficial things like the ability to sing or something like that um  i would like to be able to think a little bit faster on my feet  as i took a very long time to answer that question um i think ive given time i think i can come up with like good ideas and good responses and like handle issues in a good way um and i think that just being able to think of something a little bit quicker i know that sometimes theres like  times of crisis and it takes me a little bit longer than i would like to be able to um come up with the like ideal solution so that would be one of my things id like to change i think im able to combat it pretty well by  taking steps to you know mitigate the situation like handle it but ultimately that would be one thing id like to improve on um  i think i should get the job because im a very hard worker and in whatever position i am in i will do it to the best of my ability um i have experience in a lot of different areas um as i mentioned in my lab experience and i think the aspect that makes me unique from other people looking for this position  is my perspective um im able to see a problem pretty unbiasedly  and judge what would be the best um solution and also see potential obstacles on the way there and potential outcomes and so i think that my general overview overview of problems gives me an advantage over other people ,5.6188688468,1,im pretty well um far technical experience background go um ive work three different lab um summer freshman year work lab um mgh locate charleston work harvard graduate student phd thesis involve lot genetics lot like routine lab work um summer next um softmore year work lab mit um engelward laboratory work dna damage work essay quantified dna damage use um electrophoresis nice get learn lot um different laboratory technique im still currently work ive time delve project little bit deeper understand initially um also incorporate um component cod like use math lab area um um generate data really interest um also past summer work laboratory israel really interesting work sort biosensors um pretty broad um field work got work project ive never type independent freedom really exciting um think get get use different work place able acclimate um productive sort environment um think im definitely leader willing take charge situation um group people im afraid stand opinion hear um flipside im afraid suffer consequence uh there sort negative outcome negative positive outcome im willing handle um result um think im team player im willing agree others people um idea um question sorry could repeat conflict team okay um sorority im executive board theres u lke charge chapter um weve newly elect position kind go process work exactly goal recently one topic like handle um judiciary issue like within chapter like strong feeling subject sister able kind handle professional try unbiased um like close relation like sister chapter um challenge think able remove emotionally situation kind listen people say acknowledge really one like big step ive take kind overcome kind challenge um think think like superficial thing like ability sing something like um would like able think little bit faster foot take long time answer question um think ive give time think come like good idea good response like handle issue good way um think able think something little bit quicker know sometimes there like time crisis take little bit longer would like able um come like ideal solution would one thing id like change think im able combat pretty well take step know mitigate situation like handle ultimately would one thing id like improve um think get job im hard worker whatever position best ability um experience lot different area um mention lab experience think aspect make unique people look position perspective um im able see problem pretty unbiasedly judge would best um solution also see potential obstacle way potential outcome think general overview overview problem give advantage people
pp3,hah uh yeahso uhm im chase and i guess uh aww man okay so  ive done web development for a long time  i started in abotu 8th grade and actually started making a few sites just back then and for the heck of it and uhm just started making some money through them sold a website through them which was great uhm and through all fo this i got an internship for my sophmore year of high school  which was awesome it was through a job search website called indeed and over there i did a ton of different stuff and from internationalization  i was one of the first people to start the internationalization forum for indeed  and so theyve now expanded to four countries and i think  the international traffic revenue is like 30 of their company now they also just got sold for like a billion dollars uh i believeabout three weeks ago or something which was really cool but at the same time i dont really want to work there anymore  because they have been sold and i dont really know the owner anymore where as i did previously and that was great where i dont know  otherwise  coming to mitf you know had aphenomenal blast up there i had been studying computer scienceuhm really enjoyed it and spent a lot of time on a lot of various side projects and just ahnging out with people so like  i dont know  making really cool robotics stuff uhm like  cool educational software uhm some kinnect tax and different things like this uhmi would ii would go this i i would say there is kind of uhm from two standpoints both from high school and from college  in high school i was the captain of our ultimate frisbee teamuhm and so i started it in my junior year and just got all my friends  because we used to play frisbee all with each other and i said hey  why dont we start competing and make this happen liek three times a week or soemthing and so we went ahead and did this and uhm uh started practicing enough and i had to make sure that everything was coordinated and that people actually came to practices  i mean you like had to have everyone come and everything otherwise no one is going to wanna play or there is going to be no ability to play basically so uhm we  played enough so that we were actually able to get 3rd in uhm well actually 3rd in my senior year  5th my junior year and uh in the state of texas in frisbee which is uh impressive without a coach uh  otherwise i was also the captain of the crosscountry team and uhm  uh captain of uhm uh the track team as well  so uhm that um roles been more minimal  more of an inspirational role like make sure you come to practice sort of thing of stuff and uhm in college here ive been working with a group called saftey fp and uh  which promotes student wellness around campus  sounds like youve heard of it uhm and yeah  so just making sure we have awesome events that happen  i just recently read an event called super smash bros turned in which was really great  uhmi dont know anything about super smash bros  so i had to actually go get the the other people that knew a lot about it and made sure they told all their friends about it  and got them to actually figure out the whole thing the whole logistics and that wa sme just getting them excited about it  and and convinced them to get a lot of people to come uhm okay definitely i enjoy teams like no other  im at mit specifically  i go out of my way to like  working in teams and in any different aspect and for the most part  ive had really great teams in general  but uhm just this semester  im actually working on a start up with a friend  so hes been working on it a while and hes just such an awesome guy  that i was just like oh  i want to build stuff for you so  i am kind of doing contract work for him  we are just hacking together all the time  really just like  there are no conflicts there frankly but i find but otherwise for my year off  for my reasearch that im doing here for mit  uhm i had previously uh a research postion  at uh my freshman year  uhm but i did not really like it that much because  i had to do it by myself because it was an android thing  i mean i dont know i feel like i can always do stuff by myself  it does not have to be in a group  but now actually i just tell all my friends  if they hear about an opp they should just invite me to do it with you  because i would just love to do a year off with someone because like  id love to have someone that i like to working with and to work on the same product would make everything so much better  so like my friend does this cool photography and i just do the tech thing  it is fun  but in terms of conflicts ive had  uhm i feel like conflicts are a general minimal for the uhm the most part that i have found  its most like  who is going to do what  uhm and in these cases uhm and for the most part and uhm im pretty flexible basically  thats how i just go around stuff and just try and explain everything very well  to everyone just to make sure everyone knows exactly what is going on and just reinterating all this to everyone so that  cough cough at least then so everyone is on the same page because for the most part people generally care to be fair but you just have to describe to everyone how they understand things uhm  okay so i would   something i woudl change about myself  okay so thats interesting  uhm oh okay i would almost  uhm  heh  uhmthe dumb answer to this would be that i woudl like to be a bit taller  i think that would always help uhm but i think i can also interpret this question on what would i like to work onor what am i working on and like in thsi case  i would definitely go for uhm actually my ability to  speak ah hah and uhm just in general and uh like i find for now for example  like how i kind of seem like i understand what im tlaking about for exmample  for the most part  i  mumbles everynow and then but uhm what im actually thinking about harder problems and im trying to explain myself where i just worked on a hard problem i only looked at once so i dont fully understand everything  for the most part i get it in my head but when i try and explain it to someone  i its actually pretty hard to me and to uhmeverything in an uhm i guess interesting manner  well almost and kind of say it once instead of say something and then which is what i do freqently and then i say oh wait that does not make sense  let me try another avenue i just keep trying different avanues until the other person gets it  but i would love to be able to just give it that first time  i can just think for a second and say okay this is exactly what i need to say use the vocabulary words i need to use  which frankly im not that good at  and in terms of expanding my vocabulary and expanding my words for whatever like dictionary or see i dont even know the word  like my expanse of the vocabulary that exists in my head and uh on an given and at any given time  not as large as it should be  uhm  so i know  i i would say it just comes down to the passion for the most part  i just really enjoy anything that i am working on  if i am ever going to pck something to work on  i bascially just go at it full force  i always tlak to my friends about it  its always on my mind in the shower  its like always in the top of my mind  i am working on a problem and i have to get that problem finished  and i basically  i never really feel like suffer from burn out  that may be because i havent worked on soemthing enough uhm but uhm  for the msot part  i really enjoy working on stuff and i just  its my passion and my passion is actually just like working  when i get tired of working  i work on something else  its actually a relaxing state  like if i am working here for example  i do hard in all my classes  i just start programming i feel in a great place  im either working out or working on soemthing  i i i i think your company woudl love to see someone like that ,4.26777504976,0,hah uh yeahso im chase guess uh aww man okay ive do web development long time start abotu th grade actually start make site back heck start make money sell website great fo get internship sophmore year high school awesome job search website call indeed ton different stuff internationalization one first people start internationalization forum indeed theyve expand four country think international traffic revenue like company also get sell like billion dollar uh believeabout three week ago something really cool time dont really want work anymore sell dont really know owner anymore previously great dont know otherwise come mitf know aphenomenal blast study computer scienceuhm really enjoyed spent lot time lot various side project ahnging people like dont know make really cool robotics stuff like cool educational software kinnect tax different thing like uhmi would ii would go would say kind two standpoint high school college high school captain ultimate frisbee teamuhm start junior year get friend use play frisbee say hey dont start compete make happen liek three time week soemthing go ahead uh start practice enough make sure everything coordinate people actually come practice mean like everyone come everything otherwise one go wan na play go ability play basically play enough actually able get rd well actually rd senior year th junior year uh state texas frisbee uh impressive without coach uh otherwise also captain crosscountry team uh captain uh track team well um role minimal inspirational role like make sure come practice sort thing stuff college ive work group call saftey fp uh promote student wellness around campus sound like youve hear yeah make sure awesome event happen recently read event call super smash bros turn really great uhmi dont know anything super smash bros actually go get people know lot make sure told friend get actually figure whole thing whole logistics wa sme get excite convinced get lot people come okay definitely enjoy team like im mit specifically go way like work team different aspect part ive really great team general semester im actually work start friend hes work he awesome guy like oh want build stuff kind contract work hack together time really like conflict frankly find otherwise year reasearch im mit previously uh research postion uh freshman year really like much android thing mean dont know feel like always stuff group actually tell friend hear opp invite would love year someone like id love someone like work work product would make everything much well like friend cool photography tech thing fun term conflict ive feel like conflict general minimal part find like go case part im pretty flexible basically thats go around stuff try explain everything well everyone make sure everyone know exactly go reinterating everyone cough cough least everyone page part people generally care fair describe everyone understand thing okay would something woudl change okay thats interest oh okay would almost heh uhmthe dumb answer would woudl like bit tall think would always help think also interpret question would like work onor work like thsi case would definitely go actually ability speak ah hah general uh like find example like kind seem like understand im tlaking exmample part mumble everynow im actually think hard problem im try explain work hard problem look dont fully understand everything part get head try explain someone actually pretty hard uhmeverything guess interesting manner well almost kind say instead say something freqently say oh wait make sense let try another avenue keep try different avanues person get would love able give first time think second say okay exactly need say use vocabulary word need use frankly im good term expand vocabulary expand word whatever like dictionary see dont even know word like expanse vocabulary exists head uh give give time large know would say come passion part really enjoy anything work ever go pck something work bascially go full force always tlak friend always mind shower like always top mind work problem get problem finish basically never really feel like suffer burn may havent worked soemthing enough msot part really enjoy work stuff passion passion actually like work get tired work work something else actually relax state like work example hard class start program feel great place im either work work soemthing think company woudl love see someone like
pp30,im doing well im a student of computer science at mit im in my junior year ive been studying the whole timeive been teaching last summer in the field it was a start up in venice beach  california and i enjoyed it quite a bit i think that i ca be a leader i am definitely not one that tends to lead i am perfectly happy to play a more supportive role  because in my experience especially here there are plenty of people who like to lead and leaders are not needed that said if theres something that needs to be done and nobody is stepping up to do it that is something that i can and will adapt to i would absolutely consider myself a team player i care more about people than basically anything else conflict im sorry i am trying to think of a story so to be honest i havent experienced major conflicts in general honestly i think it is best to keep open terms of communication i that makes it so that you cant have a disaster happen there can be minor disagreements but they never turn into big conflicts id be smarter  yeah obviously but  i think i would like to have a better capability to understand those sides of things sorry that sounds really weird in general i do but for computer science or science specifically theres the part that i am really good at which is everything that has to do with languages and puzzle solving thats great thats fun i like it a lot but then there is also the side that is a little bit more mathematical and that is something that i struggle with they are definitely different things people are typically good at either one or the other but being good at both is a little less common and that would be really awesome because i think i would do a great job for you guys i care a lot about my work especially when it affects other people and i really like what this company is doing it is something that i believe in ,3.14649821165,0,im well im student computer science mit im junior year ive study whole timeive teaching last summer field start venice beach california enjoy quite bit think ca leader definitely one tend lead perfectly happy play supportive role experience especially plenty people like lead leader need say there something need do nobody step something adapt would absolutely consider team player care people basically anything else conflict im sorry try think story honest havent experience major conflict general honestly think best keep open term communication make cant disaster happen minor disagreement never turn big conflict id smart yeah obviously think would like good capability understand side thing sorry sound really weird general computer science science specifically theres part really good everything language puzzle solve thats great thats fun like lot also side little bit mathematical something struggle definitely different thing people typically good either one good little less common would really awesome think would great job guy care lot work especially affect people really like company something believe
pp31,im good  how are you uh  so im a junior in computer science and math at mit uh  im personally interested in  systems uh and uh  tolerance those are slightly more my research interests then my applied interests so when it comes to applied things  which youre probably more interested in um  i tend to prefer parallel computing um i have some experience in that from classes  um both including performance engineering and parallel computing as well as from my internship with amazon where we actually pushed a product that i made you can see it i if you look online uh author rank was my intern product  um i have some leadership experience but i think that so in my teens for 6172  which is a project based live class  its been a lot of work um i tend to be the person who does some of the organizing of team meetings but mostly within a given meeting i tend to be  like  for a nontrivial portion of the work  the person who is leading the discussions of whats the next technical step we should do  you know  should we take approach a or   should we take approach a or b based on time  work  you know  man hours we have  due dates  uh points  etcetera um  and so i  you know  perform leadership skills in a technical capacity more than a managerial one  in a sense that i dont do so much of the organizing of meeting times um  i do think im a team player  um so  can i ask what kind of flavor of conflict youre looking for like a technical disagreement or ok  um  well while i was working at amazon  um we had many times the problem that the business decision would change or um become apparent slowly over time as we continued designing because actually the design process started getting  over the internship and the product shipped shortly after my internship  so that was kind of crazy  um and you may expect with a project like that i ended up not working on the front end because it was way too much work for one intern to do for the summer  um  but  negotiating with the business team and with other technical people about what parts of the product we were going to ship was a challenge as an example  amazon often has uh  like  you know  lots of features like any company  like to employ and some of these are like change over time features and as it turns out  given the way we were implementing everything  change over time features  where it looked that longer periods of time would be much more computationally intensive and like also programmer time intensive  um both of which werent going to work for what we were trying to do for our deadline because we couldnt order more computational power within the time period and we only had so many man hours and um trying to decide what things would be worked on and what wouldnt was a conflict of the team um and i did my best  um  you know i was an intern  um but i did my best to like present the technical issues  present my understanding of how long things would take  um  and try to you know  encourage people to take the direction they wanted but in the case that a choice was made that wasnt you know  what i wanted  uh you know i would go along with it  i wasnt you know going to be petulant or continue trying to you know argue my way and not do their way  like if the team decided this was the best thing like i went ahead and did it uh  smarter um  im going to respond to this question by answering what i would change about myself thats sort of something i could just spend more time on um to change and i can tell you something that im currently working on which is that when im stressed and tired  i notice that  i become snippy  is one word for it uh  and while people who have worked with me and you know work on psats until 4 am or you know working on these intense projects  you know claim that i tend to be pretty reasonable like  it does decrease team unity and happiness  when its like getting to be 4am and i respond shortly as opposed to you know sounding nice and happy about it um so something im working on is like removing the sounds of frustration from my voice  especially in time of frustration because it more important then when everybodys frustrated and tired to like not escalate situations um and even if im not responding with anger and just responding in like a voice that portrays frustration you can worry that like itll make other people more frustrated 	 um im technically competent  i think my uh the classes ive taken and how well ive done in them as well as you know  any of the people you contact like amazon will say positive things about me uh  i get along well with people  um and so whatever team you put me on will likely enjoy my company um  and i think most importantly  computer science is a huge part of my life and what i do and i fully and legitimately enjoy my job  especially if you give interesting technical problems um and im sure thats what your company will do right so im not going to be just like sitting around  biding my time waiting for the work day to end and im actually going be here on time  and im going to leave and go home and do other things and like come back and be excited to be coming back to work and continue to work on these problems ,4.16855528833,0,im good uh im junior computer science math mit uh im personally interested system uh uh tolerance slightly research interest apply interest come applied thing youre probably interested um tend prefer parallel compute um experience class um include performance engineering parallel compute well internship amazon actually push product make see look online uh author rank intern product um leadership experience think teen project base live class lot work um tend person organize team meeting mostly within give meet tend like nontrivial portion work person leading discussion whats next technical step know take approach take approach b base time work know man hour due date uh point etcetera um know perform leadership skill technical capacity managerial one sense dont much organize meet time um think im team player um ask kind flavor conflict youre look like technical disagreement ok um well work amazon um many time problem business decision would change um become apparent slowly time continue design actually design process start get internship product ship shortly internship kind crazy um may expect project like end work front end way much work one intern summer um negotiate business team technical people part product go ship challenge example amazon often uh like know lot feature like company like employ like change time feature turn give way implement everything change time feature look long period time would much computationally intensive like also programmer time intensive um werent go work try deadline couldnt order computational power within time period many man hour um try decide thing would work wouldnt conflict team um best um know intern um best like present technical issue present understand long thing would take um try know encourage people take direction want case choice make wasnt know want uh know would go along wasnt know go petulant continue try know argue way way like team decide best thing like go ahead uh smarter um im go respond question answer would change thats sort something could spend time um change tell something im currently work im stress tired notice become snippy one word uh people work know work psats know work intense project know claim tend pretty reasonable like decrease team unity happiness like get respond shortly oppose know sound nice happy um something im work like remove sound frustration voice especially time frustration important everybodys frustrate tire like escalate situation um even im respond anger respond like voice portrays frustration worry like itll make people frustrate um im technically competent think uh class ive take well ive do well know people contact like amazon say positive thing uh get along well people um whatever team put likely enjoy company um think importantly computer science huge part life fully legitimately enjoy job especially give interesting technical problem um im sure thats company right im go like sit around bid time wait work day end im actually go time im go leave go home thing like come back excite come back work continue work problem
pp32,im good how are you  yeah  i paced here hahaha ok i am a junior at mit currently  uh working on my bachelors degree in biology and ive been heavily involved in student groups so far and during my time here ive been at  uh im currently the president of the mit armenian society  the editor in chief of the mit undergraduate research journal and uh um also executive team of the biology students association uh and i thats why im sort of trying to get into healthcare industry and consulting cuz i dont have a lot of experience in the life sciences so far i do think im a leader um  i so always end up taking the lead on uh when theres a big group and someosomeone has to start ha  taking the wheel and uh getting people started working um  ive been really involved in the groups that ive heheh  joined since my freshman year and uh so far ive done some pretty crazy things such as organizing a hundred plus networking event for the armenian society where i definitely had to um  you know uh work with uh the team and get them motivated enough to help me with this like big task  a lot of peoplea lot of kids on my team dont really like the whole social um event planning part of things  but um i had to kind of engage them and uh that was an interesting thing for me to learn actually how to tap into what makes people take and what gets them motivated so how to give them initiative to do things on their own so  yeah  yeah uh definitely  iii would say that im a team player and um one thing i can say is that uh last year at the mit  mit undergraduate research role we uh had to publish an issue uh in the fall where it became late and we had to uh work together as a team to get that done uh one  one thing that may  i may have done wrong on my part was maybe iii didnt um get my department to uh work hard enough to get the deadline  make the deadline so um in the spring semester when we were trying to uh make it make uh make the deadline in the spring semester to publish uh in the first week of the spring semester i had to do the same thing that i did with our research ior was get everyone to be motivated and have initiative to do things on their own and really like work hard to get tah that deadline so yeah mhmm interesting question uh i would change my lack of willingness that sometimes to approach new people and you know put myself into new situations that im not comfortable with um ii definitely have thethe whatever i am comfortable with i feel very confident and i come off as confident at the moment heh  but  um  i sometimes imiwhenever i approach those new situations im pretty  im pretty shy and ii dont i dont feel comfortable so one thing i would like to change my about myself is being more adventurous and being more of a risktaker and ii feel like im too controlled at times but that has gotten me also aha very far but its always good to be a balanced person hahahaha k so im a good leader  as i uh said i uh organize a team of around 10 people to organize 100 networking event people networking event  um i have this ability to understand people where like i which i have to do when i uh have to uh get people to be motivated and like realize what made them take and what made them have initiative on their own so i have a good sense of understanding people um and third  i like i said im very controlling  like yknow not controlling but  wrong word  controlled  haha ii like to uh really get organized and really um put alot of effort into sort of you know um i guess i guess perfecting every aspect of thea project that im working on whether it be an event  aaa homework assignment  whatever so uh i have that ability as well yep ,5.35450601117,1,im good yeah pace hahaha ok junior mit currently uh work bachelor degree biology ive heavily involved student group far time ive uh im currently president mit armenian society editor chief mit undergraduate research journal uh um also executive team biology student association uh thats im sort try get healthcare industry consult cuz dont lot experience life science far think im leader um always end take lead uh there big group someosomeone start ha take wheel uh get people start work um ive really involved group ive heheh join since freshman year uh far ive do pretty crazy thing organize hundred plus networking event armenian society definitely um know uh work uh team get motivate enough help like big task lot peoplea lot kid team dont really like whole social um event plan part thing um kind engage uh interesting thing learn actually tap make people take get motivate give initiative thing yeah yeah uh definitely iii would say im team player um one thing say uh last year mit mit undergraduate research role uh publish issue uh fall become late uh work together team get do uh one one thing may may do wrong part maybe iii didnt um get department uh work hard enough get deadline make deadline um spring semester try uh make make uh make deadline spring semester publish uh first week spring semester thing research ior get everyone motivate initiative thing really like work hard get tah deadline yeah mhmm interest question uh would change lack willingness sometimes approach new people know put new situation im comfortable um ii definitely thethe whatever comfortable feel confident come confident moment heh um sometimes imiwhenever approach new situation im pretty im pretty shy ii dont dont feel comfortable one thing would like change adventurous risktaker ii feel like im control time get also aha far always good balance person hahahaha k im good leader uh say uh organize team around people organize networking event people network event um ability understand people like uh uh get people motivate like realize make take make initiative good sense understand people um third like say im control like yknow control wrong word control haha ii like uh really get organize really um put alot effort sort know um guess guess perfect every aspect thea project im work whether event aaa homework assignment whatever uh ability well yep
pp33, good  how are you  so  my background is primarily in energy work  so  im a chemical engineering student and im very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources  um  so thats  thats where my  uh  background in  well in gas comes in  um  but also some of my research interests are you know  kind of scientific ideas um  i definitely think i am  uh  partially because even when im not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team  but i really enjoy that  i think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that youre doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you  so  i think that in terms of my leadership style i always want to bring out the strengths of  the team members  so i think thats really how my position as a leader really works  i try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member  and how can we bring all of those together um  yeah  so  i definitely consider myself a team player  its tough to be a good leader without being a good team player  ah  but one instance where i was both the leader and also a team player um  was in the society of women engineers banquet  so  when we planned it  it wasim the vice president of corporate relations and i have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people  both company representatives and students  and um  and its a very collaborative effort  like  i may be the vp but were all you know  pulling a lot of the weight  and so during the actual event  we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without rsvping or anything  uh  it was  the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive  so what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests  so its not something where you can be like  oh yeah  sit right down but  so  in terms of being a team player  they approached one of the other members of the team  she didnt really know what to do um  kind of bounced it to a few different people but i knew that that was something that wouldnt look good  so i definitely helped her out  out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that  oh  you dont have our name tags  you dont have our seats  whats going on  and so i  you know  part of being a team player is knowing when its best to take the blame on yourself  and in the end we found places for them to sit  so  we had some noshow students  you know  among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that dont show up  so they didnt get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner  so  that helped  i wish i was more patient  um  i think i  a lot of times and very eager to start a task  this especially comes out  uh  were in a lab group right now  or  im in a lab class and i work with a lab group  um  in that class and we are all  we kind of have this trait of  um  oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench  oh lets mix this  lets do this  lets do this  but a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to  we problem solve  we get all the problems first  you know  other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesnt work at all  so  we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had  if we could take a few minutes wait  think it out  uh  maybe let somebody else try something first for a change  um  i think that would helps us be a little bit more effective  and i think in other situations too its kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but its sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities  so i definitely  thats definitely something that ive been working on  is  you know  when  when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it  i think that i would bring a great deal of enthusiasm  in addition to the skills and background that i have  i think that im so excited  um  for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well  um  so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team ,5.29600706178,1,good background primarily energy work im chemical engineering student im interested alternative energy optimization traditional energy resource um thats thats uh background well gas come um also research interest know kind scientific idea um definitely think uh partially even im designate leader somehow turn lead team really enjoy think one satisfying feeling team tel youre great job think um success highly attributed think term leadership style always want bring strength team member think thats really position leader really work try figure would maximize potential team member team member bring together um yeah definitely consider team player tough good leader without good team player ah one instance leader also team player um society woman engineer banquet plan wasim vice president corporate relation six people work plan banquet people company representative student um collaborative effort like may vp know pull lot weight actual event four company representative two different company show event without rsvping anything uh selection company pretty extensive selection student pretty extensive try get good range industry match student interest something like oh yeah sit right term team player approach one member team didnt really know um kind bounce different people know something wouldnt look good definitely help awkward situation kind take blame essentially representative pretty angry oh dont name tag dont seat whats go know part team player know best take blame end find place sit noshow student know among like hundred whatever student definitely people dont show didnt get sit like exactly right student anything find place fed dinner help wish patient um think lot time eager start task especially come uh lab group right im lab class work lab group um class kind trait um oh soon chemical bench oh let mix let let lot time end finish little bit later group problem solve get problem first know people necessarily try find doesnt work face hurdle first whereas could take minute wait think uh maybe let somebody else try something first change um think would help u little bit effective think situation kind strategic advantageous wait sometimes hard see opportunity definitely thats definitely something ive working know also viable option sit back day think think would bring great deal enthusiasm addition skill background think im excited um work company kind play member team well um stick project also contribute project go try find synergy within team
pp34,doing pretty good so i am a  uh  mechanical engineer at mit umm  i am a junior  and im really interested in product design so ive been taking a lot of classes in design and manufacturing  and its something ive really fallen in love withlike last semester  um  especially  i took this class called025 unclear product design  and its really got me introduced to solid works and using machine tools  and its something that id love to do in  um  for the rest of my life in a professional fashion uh  i would say that i am i do enjoy being in a position where i can really guide a group  um  towards some forward direction  uh so  this past year  i was philanthropy chair of my sorority  and we put on this big event called cat walk its this charity fashion show um  and its  its so much fun  but it took tons of planning  and yeah  coordination between  like  throughout the entire sorority  which has onehundred forty girls in it um  and everyone had to play a role  so itsreally difficult sometimes cause people arent really sure whats going on  and theres a lot of miscommunication and things umm  but i feel like it ran really smoothly  um  because i had two cochairs  and we all really worked together to keep things very organized  um  regimented to  like  keep after peopleespecially in the summer when everyones all over the country  all over the world right and you have to just keep emailing them  calling them if you can  um  checking up on them  but  you know finding a balance  you have to learn to trust the people that are under you  right um  and just make sure they have a good idea of whats going on  and they feel like theyre playing an important role  because they are um  so that happened actually two weeks ago the event it was so much fun it was a little bit stressful as we got closer to the event you know  things go wrong  and things go missing um but i feel like i was able to stay very calm  and just  like  help people find alternatives if theyif  i dont know  if  like  a rehearsal time didnt work  or a designer wasnt showing up um  it was just best to find a very efficient  logical way to proceed uh  i would say that im a team player again  like even when in a leadership role  youre not just the one person doing the thing um  i would say that being a team player applied to cat walk as well  but  um  for a different example  perhaps i might return to  to product design  where we had to work in a smaller team of about  uh  there were five students and two mentors um  and we all came from different backgrounds  and none of us knew each other beforehand we all had very different skill sets and very different personalities um  so in the beginning  especially  we all had ideas that really clashed  and for the class  in a way that was good  because then we could come up with all these different ideas  and its great but then  when it came down to deciding on one or figuring out how you wanted to move forward  who would take on which responsibilities  it was  um  quite tense laughs for our team  i would say um  so  as the oldest two on the team  myself and one other teammate  we i feel like we really stepped it up in terms of being  um  very methodical and very  like fair  i guess in the way that we tried to distribute things and when things got too heated  um  i feel like i especially served as kind of a mediator  calming people down and just  like  having them think about  yknow  whats practical  what are you actually able to get done um  what do you want to get done cause you want to make sure that people work on things that theyre passionate about  um  so they can do their best work um  i feel like thats just a role that i play in a lot of team situations um  helping our team to find a balance so that we can work together most effectively uh  for me  i would definitely try to laughs raise my own confidence level um  or my ability to be more assertive i think that when im in a team situation where there are very strong personalities  i tend toi dont mind sharing my ideas  but then  as soon as i do  if it receives like a lot of criticism or some sort of  um  opposition  ill tend to back down  um  and just kind of let it go and move forward on something else  but then sometimes those ideas  they turn out to be good ones  in the end and its just like we kind of wasted time um  if only i had more solid arguments to go off of so i try to do a lot more planning on my own time um  so that i do have a solid foundation to go off if i dont get really scared or feel like the ideas i come up with are worthless  and i cant defend them i think i should get the job becausethis position just sounds so ideal for me  um  it seems like a place  like a very collaborative environment where i can really call on different  uh  team members in the office itself  um  to just help me further my own ideas and i have a lot of room for creative freedom in this product design positionum  because from what ive found out through research and talking to  uh  541 unclear or company members  um is just that were often given a challenge thats very dynamic  and theres always problems to be solved and  um  things to innovate on andthey basically just say go do it um  and i think thats really exciting to me because i dontim not a big fan of  of just doing things very rotely  like  heres how i want you to do it um  just  like  build exactly what these directions tell you to do um  not quite what im looking for  and so i think this company  um  this position just really  really excites me ,5.2122136212,1,pretty good uh mechanical engineer mit junior im really interested product design ive taking lot class design manufacture something ive really fall love withlike last semester um especially take class call unclear product design really get introduced solid work use machine tool something id love um rest life professional fashion uh would say enjoy position really guide group um towards forward direction uh past year philanthropy chair sorority put big event call cat walk charity fashion show um much fun take ton plan yeah coordination like throughout entire sorority onehundred forty girl um everyone play role itsreally difficult sometimes cause people arent really sure whats go there lot miscommunication thing feel like ran really smoothly um two cochairs really work together keep thing organize um regiment like keep peopleespecially summer everyones country world right keep email call um checking know find balance learn trust people right um make sure good idea whats go feel like theyre play important role um happen actually two week ago event much fun little bit stressful get closer event know thing go wrong thing go miss um feel like able stay calm like help people find alternative theyif dont know like rehearsal time didnt work designer wasnt show um best find efficient logical way proceed uh would say im team player like even leadership role youre one person thing um would say team player apply cat walk well um different example perhaps might return product design work small team uh five student two mentor um come different background none u knew beforehand different skill set different personality um begin especially idea really clash class way good could come different idea great come decide one figuring want move forward would take responsibility um quite tense laugh team would say um old two team one teammate feel like really step term um methodical like fair guess way try distribute thing thing get heat um feel like especially serve kind mediator calm people like think yknow whats practical actually able get do um want get do cause want make sure people work thing theyre passionate um best work um feel like thats role play lot team situation um help team find balance work together effectively uh would definitely try laugh raise confidence level um ability assertive think im team situation strong personality tend toi dont mind share idea soon receives like lot criticism sort um opposition ill tend back um kind let go move forward something else sometimes ideas turn good one end like kind waste time um solid argument go try lot plan time um solid foundation go dont get really scared feel like idea come worthless cant defend think get job becausethis position sound ideal um seem like place like collaborative environment really call different uh team member office um help idea lot room creative freedom product design positionum ive find research talk uh unclear company member um often give challenge thats dynamic there always problem solve um thing innovate andthey basically say go um think thats really excite dontim big fan thing rotely like here want um like build exactly direction tell um quite im look think company um position really really excites
pp35,fine  thanks  how are you  well im a junior at mit and currently im majoring in computer science and molecular biology with a minor in management um  my work background  ive done a year op at uh  in boydens lab  uh which is in neurobiology lab and i really like that  but im interested in maybe pursuing finance as a career so  the past two summers  um  ive worked in financial services um  my freshman summer i worked at standard  poors  and last summer i worked at wells fargo   uh  i definitely think im a leader because  uh  currently im on a lot of planning boards for different things  uh  im actually on the executive board on smart womens securities which is a finance club  and ive really helped it grow from a very small group of about ten members to now we have like 30 or 40 students attending each of our seminar series so its been great being in a marketing role for that club  uh  because ive been able to pub on campus and get people to come out to our events uh  yes  i think im a team player um  one time  this was for one of my classes  we had a project  uh it was in a class called software programming in java so  the project was actually centered after spring break and it was due on that wednesday  however  one of my friends  who was supposed to be in charge of another part of the project  was gone the entire spring break  on a bike trip  and didnt bring his computer so he came back to school and said  guys  sorry i havent done anything  and well  that was a very bad conflict for our team  so i kind of took charge and said  look  okay  ill finish the parser  and you write  just test cases for the entire program instead since  obviously  you havent even started looking at it  so  yeah  we ended up getting an a on that project  thankfully  but it was a marathon sprint to the finish  this is a very loaded question um  i think one thing  i might change about myself is being a little bit more proactive in everything i do  sometimes im a little too passive  but  yeah  i think thats the main thing i would change about myself  i would try to make myself take more initiatives i think i should get the job because im a very strong candidate in this industry and i have a lot of prior experience in finance  so also  im very motivated and ill get work done ,5.73025318131,1,fine thanks well im junior mit currently im major computer science molecular biology minor management um work background ive do year op uh boydens lab uh neurobiology lab really like im interested maybe pursue finance career past two summer um ive work financial service um freshman summer work standard poor last summer work well fargo uh definitely think im leader uh currently im lot planning board different thing uh im actually executive board smart womens security finance club ive really help grow small group ten member like student attend seminar series great marketing role club uh ive able pub campus get people come event uh yes think im team player um one time one class project uh class call software program java project actually center spring break due wednesday however one friend suppose charge another part project go entire spring break bike trip didnt bring computer come back school say guy sorry havent do anything well bad conflict team kind take charge say look okay ill finish parser write test case entire program instead since obviously havent even start look yeah end get project thankfully marathon sprint finish load question um think one thing might change little bit proactive everything sometimes im little passive yeah think thats main thing would change would try make take initiative think get job im strong candidate industry lot prior experience finance also im motivate ill get work do
pp37,little cold pretty well how are you i have some quantity and analytical experience from qua work on financial team last summer in terms of working experience a in terms of academic experience i have a apply a math major probably double major with course fifteen which is management so i taken a lot of probability statistics classes ah  i think i am a leader mainly because i take a leadership positions  i can be very effective in guiding the group whatever it is toward our goal if it is team in the class on the research project even if there is a like assign leadership role i usually end up organizing things between people stuff like that so i do feel like i am a little bet a natural leader a  when i was in competitive swimming summer for fifteen years pretty much my whole life and so i had lots of different experiences being on the swim team specially on  i did for two years specialty on m rely team there is only four slots on the rely and we are usually very competitive on the national level so last year we had lots of conflict  a because one of my best fiends really wonted to be on the rely but then you know she is getting bit up by a teammates and there is all that drama over that and it put me in a tough position because was my best friend but then was also you know you wont to put together the fastest rely to be competitive so really all of was wont to stay out of it and let the coaches deal with that but i did learn a lot about how to interact with people on all sides of the situation because i steel had to get along with all my teammates and support my best friend and try to help her i think i would like to be better in asking for help not that i necessarily needed a lot but i think it would be useful for me and like branch out and learn from different people so i am really interested in math and management so i get really into those types of classes i guess i wish i would branch out little bet more in to different areas because i can learn from people there si i am trying to take some different classes now that i ma done with all of my math and stuff like that thats probably what i should change i think  i should get the job because i am really qualified i have the qua experience as well some of the financial background i am also just a hard worker really excited to learn more in the job and since this is a such learning internship i think i could really thrive in that environment ,5.39724331077,1,little cold pretty well quantity analytical experience qua work financial team last summer term work experience term academic experience apply math major probably double major course fifteen management take lot probability statistic class ah think leader mainly take leadership position effective guide group whatever toward goal team class research project even like assign leadership role usually end organize thing people stuff like feel like little bet natural leader competitive swimming summer fifteen year pretty much whole life lot different experience swim team specially two year specialty rely team four slot rely usually competitive national level last year lot conflict one best fiends really wonted rely know get bit teammate drama put tough position best friend also know wont put together fast rely competitive really wont stay let coach deal learn lot interact people side situation steel get along teammate support best friend try help think would like good ask help necessarily need lot think would useful like branch learn different people really interested math management get really types class guess wish would branch little bet different area learn people si try take different class do math stuff like thats probably change think get job really qualified qua experience well financial background also hard worker really excite learn job since learn internship think could really thrive environment
pp4,sure  uh  my names isaiah im an mit student i am currently a junior in the department of aeronautics and astronautics  um  and so i  im mainly focusing on the information systems behind uhh  aeronautics and  uhh  aeronautical and astronautical flight systems  umm  my course work basically has included a fair amount of the basics of aeronautics and astronautics thats covered at mit  uhh  in addition to that ive covered a lot of programming and programming work  umm  both in and out of school  umm  so that has included  uhh  basically building a uav from scratch  as well as umm  working on uav programming for the department of defense  umm  which has  uhh  been done for collision avoidance for a lot of the uavs now flying in the air   so  yeah  i do think im a leader  umm  so for example  uhh right now im actually holding several different leadership positions  uhh  first of all i am the residential director for a group called medlinks in my dorm  uhh  what we do is we provide students  uhh  health care support  basically  uhh  we are authorized to give out over the counter medicines to other students  uhh  in our dorm  and as well  as well as elsewhere  uhh were certified first aid and some basic emergency care  and were also there for  uhh  basically student health counseling  um  so  in my position as residential director  umm  i basically talk to the dorm executive board as well as the medlinks executive board  and uhh  we basically work together  i work as the liason between the groups  um  and i basically help plan events  um  i work with them to resolve whatever issues are coming up  i xx meetings for them  umm  basically to help support basically the people who support our dorm  umm  in addition to that  i kind of have like a quirky side leadership position which is umm as president of the mit tapioca club  umm  we make and distribute large quantities of tapioca  so every once in a while  umm  we will  i will be organizing a whole bunch of students getting together maybe like a night or two of crazy cooking  umm  you know  ha ha umm  sure  so  uhh  yes i do consider myself a team player  ive had to work in a whole bunch of different teams  for example  one time there was a bit of a conflict  umm  well it was basically when last year i was working on a  uhh  one of my assignments for an engineering class  uh  we had a problem  in which basically one of the students wouldnt show up  one of the other students  xx let me get this straight  one of the students had trouble showing up for basically the team meetings  and another one of them kind of basically got xx at that  so the way i helped umm sort of resolve this conflict and basically bring everybody together to try to work out the project was i basically took it upon myself to help the person to figure out why the person who wasnt showing up wasnt showing up  umm  and i basically helped him work through some of the stuff that he had issues with  mainly he wasnt showing up mainly because he felt he didnt like wasnt able to contribute enough  didnt know enough about the programs we were working with  so i basically sat there and talked him through it  helped him basically develop some of the skills necessary to work with it  so in that way he basically showed up a lot more  he was much more productive and useful to the team  and that also um basically helped resolve the conflict we had in which we had you know we avoided losing a team member basically  and we avoided another problem of umm  basically  an annoyed team member having to deal with a person who he felt wasnt doing his job um  so this is actually something that i am actively working on  i feel that i should be more compassionate  um  this is actually something that um  so during my medlinks training  something that actually appeared  um  basically what we were doing  we were doing a bit of an exercise  um  in which we were presented with a couple of different cases  to basically  umm  illustrate  how it might be for a person to go through some very  very difficult  uh  i guess  difficult times or difficult trials  um  and so we were basic  we were given scenarios to imagine sort of  like umm  maybe the loss of a loved one or the loss of a secure place to be  uh  loss of some sort of  you know  a whole bunch of different losing things  and  um  i guess i wasnt  i wasnt as moved as other students were  primarily because ive been through all of the examples that they gave  so  i dont know  i guess on one hand thats a good thing on the other hand thats a bad thing  but umm  what that pointed out to me was that like i wasnt perhaps able to empathize as well as the others were  um  despite  i dont know  either despite  or specifically because  i had been through that  and um  part of the reason that i joined medlinks and am now currently actually trying to join the mitems  umm  not because i want to pursue medicine as a career  but one  because i want to develop those skills  and two because i want to sort of develop and exercise more compassion um  so i think i should get the job basically because of one  my past experiences  which have prepared me fairly well for the kind of employee that your looking for  a person with good strong aerospace and science background  as well as strong coding skills that are necessary for the umm basically kind of projects that i know you are working on  additionally  i feel that i am a very reliable person  um  i have demonstrated that through my leadership positions  through the things that i have  initia  um  sort of taken the initiative to engage in  such as the various programs i mentioned  and you know  the things i am trying to do right now  because of that i feel that i would be a valuable asset to your team its what it sounds like  we try to make it more than boba tea  umm  currently we have primarily made boba tea  so its like  i think weve done like two or three events  and basically every time its like ok im gonna go to china town  get like twenty to thirty pounds of tapioca  bring it back  and then like well spend like basically a night or two cooking  making large quantities of tea i think what were trying to do right now is kind of actually get enough funds to get a cup sealing machine  that way the club will be self sustainable  cause like right now its mit funded  but its so new that they wont give it consistent funding  we have to apply for new grants so were like  oh you know  were paying mit all this money to be here  why not make them give us money for food ,4.42848254782,0,sure uh name isaiah im mit student currently junior department aeronautics astronautics um im mainly focus information system behind aeronautics aeronautical astronautical flight system course work basically include fair amount basic aeronautics astronautics thats cover mit addition ive cover lot program program work school include basically build uav scratch well work uav program department defense do collision avoidance lot uavs fly air yeah think im leader example right im actually hold several different leadership position first residential director group call medlinks dorm provide student health care support basically authorize give counter medicine student dorm well well elsewhere certify first aid basic emergency care also basically student health counsel um position residential director basically talk dorm executive board well medlinks executive board basically work together work liason group um basically help plan event um work resolve whatever issue come xx meeting basically help support basically people support dorm addition kind like quirky side leadership position president mit tapioca club make distribute large quantity tapioca every organize whole bunch student get together maybe like night two crazy cooking know ha ha sure yes consider team player ive work whole bunch different team example one time bit conflict well basically last year work one assignment engineering class uh problem basically one student wouldnt show one student xx let get straight one student trouble show basically team meeting another one kind basically get xx way help sort resolve conflict basically bring everybody together try work project basically take upon help person figure person wasnt show wasnt show basically help work stuff issue mainly wasnt show mainly felt didnt like wasnt able contribute enough didnt know enough program work basically sat talk help basically develop skill necessary work way basically show lot much productive useful team also um basically help resolve conflict know avoid lose team member basically avoid another problem basically annoy team member deal person felt wasnt job um actually something actively work feel compassionate um actually something um medlinks train something actually appear um basically bite exercise um present couple different case basically illustrate might person go difficult uh guess difficult time difficult trial um basic give scenario imagine sort like maybe loss love one loss secure place uh loss sort know whole bunch different lose thing um guess wasnt wasnt move student primarily ive example give dont know guess one hand thats good thing hand thats bad thing point like wasnt perhaps able empathize well others um despite dont know either despite specifically um part reason join medlinks currently actually try join mitems want pursue medicine career one want develop skill two want sort develop exercise compassion um think get job basically one past experience prepare fairly well kind employee look person good strong aerospace science background well strong cod skill necessary basically kind project know work additionally feel reliable person um demonstrate leadership position thing initia um sort take initiative engage various program mention know thing try right feel would valuable asset team sound like try make boba tea currently primarily make boba tea like think weve do like two three event basically every time like ok im gon na go china town get like twenty thirty pound tapioca bring back like well spend like basically

new grant like oh know pay mit money make give u money food
pp42,my background is i grew up in japan and wanted to go to mit to study aerospace engineering  wanted to fly for a very long time now i am in sigma alpha epsilon  a fraternity on campus and i am also a member of air force rotc  i do think im a leader i have had many opportunities to lead um  both in a  in a range of environments where its  its pure leadership and also areas its very clear that im the one in charge  and that people should be listening to me and ive also had a good amount of theoretical education on this  and most of those opportunities and the educations been through rotc but i have also had a decent amount of chances to lead through things  like student government in high school and through my fraternity in college  i do think im a team player i like to be on part of a team where the mission is something i agree with  and if i am then ill work my absolute hardest and try to make sacrifices for the team in terms of a team that had conflict that i was um  i was apart of  uh hmm let me think of examples i didnt use the first time pause i have to go back to high school um  so student government was a really big thing for me in high school it was probably my favorite activity  my favorite nonathletic activity that i did  and it was a little bit difficult to get participation  especially during busier times for school  because people would have so many other commitments to go to so  in some of the committees we had  inside student government junior  senior year  there would just be not enough people for not even a quorum to be reached so the way i tried to change that was just making the events we do more fun and having people specifically agree on those things that were on the committee beforehand so then they  we knew that everybody had kind of an investment in it one thing about myself  hmm laughs well kind of as a joke right now  one thing definitely have a leg thats healed  um  but  i guess laughs personality traits are something of that nature pause um  i think i can be a little bit more agr  or not a little bit  a decently am  a decent more  a decent amount more agreeable sometimes  i certainly can have an opinion on a stance and once its developed its quite hard to change i can dig my heels in when someones kind of trying to argue the congress so  if i could be just a little more open minded and certainly more agreeable i think that would help me out in the long run i think that i should be able to get this job because i have a lot to contribute to the company i learn so much in my undergrad  and ive been wanting to apply that to a real  to a tough problem  that has real uh  repercussions to the general public and ive learned a lot of uh  theoretical knowledge on  on how to solve these problems ive also learned a lot of practical things by being in projects  and working in groups  and  and learning how to handle a range  or a multitude of different dynamics  um  i  if  if the team is working towards a goal  which i agree on  and this company certainly is i  ill put absolutely a hundred percent of effort into it  and work late  and  and really try to get that goal  um  or really try to work towards that goal ,5.78039323506,1,background grow japan want go mit study aerospace engineering want fly long time sigma alpha epsilon fraternity campus also member air force rotc think im leader many opportunity lead um range environment pure leadership also area clear im one charge people listen ive also good amount theoretical education opportunity education rotc also decent amount chance lead thing like student government high school fraternity college think im team player like part team mission something agree ill work absolute hard try make sacrifice team term team conflict um apart uh hmm let think example didnt use first time pause go back high school um student government really big thing high school probably favorite activity favorite nonathletic activity little bit difficult get participation especially busy time school people would many commitment go committee inside student government junior senior year would enough people even quorum reach way tried change make event fun people specifically agree thing committee beforehand know everybody kind investment one thing hmm laugh well kind joke right one thing definitely leg thats heal um guess laugh personality trait something nature pause um think little bit agr little bit decently decent decent amount agreeable sometimes certainly opinion stance develop quite hard change dig heel someone kind try argue congress could little open mind certainly agreeable think would help long run think able get job lot contribute company learn much undergrad ive want apply real tough problem real uh repercussion general public ive learn lot uh theoretical knowledge solve problem ive also learn lot practical thing project work group learn handle range multitude different dynamic um team work towards goal agree company certainly ill put absolutely hundred percent effort work late really try get goal um really try work towards goal
pp43,sure so i am matchmaking computer science double major at mit i worked in the producttech and business space before umm doing both uh front end web development  for example  at next job and product management  for example  at douche ban  the german railway and disney parks and resorts online sure i think ii am umm one example of that is im the president of baker houseits a dorm at mit umm and as part of that itheres about twenty members of the executive committee um and we run um events during the year about a fifty thousand dollar budget um so making sure all of those run run smoothly um  that there arent conflicts between members of the team  that the umm other business of baker house gets done and gets done in an efficient way and a way thats good for the residents that are there sure  so this semor this past summer at disney uh we had a challenge once with the time zones um and how they would be uh and how the app would be able to use time zones so  we uh spent some time to got everyone on the phone together on a conference call and talked about umm what the app would have to do in order to support time zones  sure i think thethe one thing that i um you know  maybe iimaybe itsits a false sort of sense of of what umm of something but at mit it always seems like some people get the answers to some questions faster than i do and umm you know  its its probably just you know  their particular field that they are good in but you know some magical way of of you know  being able to do that would be good  uhh huh yep mmmhmm  absolutely umm you know  i think its something that iveive certainly done before  something that im able to pick up quickly and uh really customize it you know  to this particular company umm and i think thats you know  theres theres few other candidates that have had this sort of graph of experience that ive had yep no problem  ,5.64187217109,1,sure matchmaking computer science double major mit work producttech business space uh front end web development example next job product management example douche ban german railway disney park resort online sure think ii one example im president baker houseits dorm mit part itheres twenty member executive committee um run um event year fifty thousand dollar budget um make sure run run smoothly um arent conflict member team business baker house get do get do efficient way way thats good resident sure semor past summer disney uh challenge time zone um would uh app would able use time zone uh spent time get everyone phone together conference call talk app would order support time zone sure think thethe one thing um know maybe iimaybe itsits false sort sense something mit always seem like people get answer question faster know probably know particular field good know magical way know able would good huh yep mmmhmm absolutely know think something iveive certainly do something im able pick quickly uh really customize know particular company think thats know theres there candidate sort graph experience ive yep problem
pp44, sure  um  clears throat sorry  uh  i am a junior in computer science here at mit  im from   kentucky  uh  particularly interesting in  uh  consumer  products  um  front end development  um  ive had some experience doing both web development and some  uh  internal metrics testing and qa type of jobs  so  thats a little bit about my technical background i do think im a leader  i think one of the biggest qualities a leader needs to have is dealing with people  uh  people skills are very important  ive been involved in many situations that  uh  involve both conflict resolution with people  involve organizing people towards a certain  a certain purpose or goal  which i think is  uh  very important  uh  quality of being a leader  for example  um  previous  uh  work  uh  ive done with one of  organizations on campus  called camp  of mit  uh  we had a committee that  my  myself and my cocoordinator had a committee which we  we used to organize the unions for campers and  um  newsletters for  uh  families  uh  to give you more context with that  uh  my job in that organization was to be a liaison between organization  which was a student camp  a student run camp for kids whose parents have or had had cancer   and being a liaison for the organization in the families who go to that camp  so  that was my whole last year and i believe i was able to organize  uh  i believe pretty effectively  right now  im  uh  also a member of the mit dance troupe  which  uh  is a dance group on campus  and ive  uh  im choreog    im a choreographer  so  im organizing people there and definitely making sure we meet our deadlines on time for the big show that we hold every semester  so  i think i can  uh  organize people pretty effectively and  uh  have a really good   sure  okay  um  i think  dealing with  doing these  lets go with  so  uh  the same organization  camp  organization  last year as the coordinator for the  uh  families  a big challenge for us was  uh  organizing our data  um  so  how that  so  essentially  what i mean by that is each  uh  family had to apply  uh  with their campers applications  but the applications itself are pretty  pretty heavy and require a lot of information  doctors records  medical records  and so people would send in their applications at different parts   uh  during the year  um  so they would never usually send in a full application  so  keeping track of that  um  proved to be pretty  pretty challenging in itself  um  there were about three of us that they would send different parts to  uh  and there were about ninety campers or about a hundred campers who ended up sending in documents  so  uh  making sure that  uh  my team was communicating was important  very  very important  in order to get through that   um  we decided to develop a  uh  sort of tool for  uh  organizing  in the sense that    uh  whoever received that piece of the application would enter it in to this sort of database we decided to construct  uh  fill in the application and contact the family saying what they were missing and what they have turned in  cause sometimes there was a little bit of a lasp sic in communication about who was to tell the parents about what they were missing and things of that nature  uh  i think it worked pretty well  uh  it was definitely a system which could be used in future years  um   unfortunately  they switch to a different system  an online system  this year  so we dont implement anymore  that was a pretty solid system    yeah  k  i think for me     um  wristtaking  risktaking is probably something i could  uh  work on  now  i dont mean by risktaking  taking risks just for the sake of risks  but being more open to  uh  trying something im not  uh  particularly  uh  familiar with or  uh  dont know exactly what the outcome is going to be  uh  its definitely something i could  uh  give more thought towards  im generally a conservative person when making decisions and trying to go with  um  solutions that i can definitely plan out and foresee  but i understand that  especially in the real world there are times when  uh  you just dont know whats going to happen with  uh  later down the line and decisions have to be made  so  keeping that in mind  um  knowing when to take risk and definitely being more open to alternative ways of  uh  going down a certain path to a solution is something i could  uh  id  uh  id like to change about myself    mm  so  uh  i think that the biggest  one of the biggest qualities in me  for me  is  uh  being able to  uh  being eager and able to learn very quickly  im a very eager  um  to learn individual  ive  uh  come into internships before not knowing much about the sort of technology and frameworks they use  for example  this past summer  at my internship at this small company  uh  i had never used ruby or many of the javascript frameworks they had used before  uh  and many of the testing frameworks  and i just have to hit the ground running  but i think i have a very  uh  big enthusiasm for learning new things and its one of  uh  the greatest joys in the world to me is to  like  go in and just learn  uh  a new technology and put it into practice  so  i think that  uh  what i may lack for in experience i more than make up for in  uh  very eager  um  to learn  uh  attitude and ability to pick up things pretty quickly in practice  no problem  thanks for having me   ,4.86738743902,1,sure um clear throat sorry uh junior computer science mit im kentucky uh particularly interesting uh consumer product um front end development um ive experience web development uh internal metric test qa type job thats little bit technical background think im leader think one big quality leader need deal people uh people skill important ive involve many situation uh involve conflict resolution people involve organize people towards certain certain purpose goal think uh important uh quality leader example um previous uh work uh ive do one organization campus call camp mit uh committee cocoordinator committee use organize union camper um newsletter uh family uh give context uh job organization liaison organization student camp student run camp kid whose parent cancer liaison organization family go camp whole last year believe able organize uh believe pretty effectively right im uh also member mit dance troupe uh dance group campus ive uh im choreog im choreographer im organize people definitely make sure meet deadline time big show hold every semester think uh organize people pretty effectively uh really good sure okay um think deal let go uh organization camp organization last year coordinator uh family big challenge u uh organize data um essentially mean uh family apply uh camper application application pretty pretty heavy require lot information doctor record medical record people would send application different part uh year um would never usually send full application keep track um prove pretty pretty challenge um three u would send different part uh ninety camper hundred camper end send document uh make sure uh team communicate important important order get um decide develop uh sort tool uh organize sense uh whoever receive piece application would enter sort database decide construct uh fill application contact family say miss turn cause sometimes little bit lasp sic communication tell parent miss thing nature uh think work pretty well uh definitely system could use future year um unfortunately switch different system online system year dont implement anymore pretty solid system yeah k think um wristtaking risktaking probably something could uh work dont mean risktaking take risk sake risk open uh try something im uh particularly uh familiar uh dont know exactly outcome go uh definitely something could uh give thought towards im generally conservative person make decision try go um solution definitely plan foresee understand especially real world time uh dont know whats go happen uh later line decision make keep mind um know take risk definitely open alternative way uh go certain path solution something could uh id uh id like change mm uh think big one big quality uh able uh eager able learn quickly im eager um learn individual ive uh come internship know much sort technology framework use example past summer internship small company uh never use ruby many javascript framework use uh many test framework hit ground run think uh big enthusiasm learn new thing one uh great joys world like go learn uh new technology put practice think uh may lack experience make uh eager um learn uh attitude ability pick thing pretty quickly practice problem thanks
pp45,ok  so im a student here at mit  and i love to study electrical engineering and computer science umm  you know  very quantitatively minded im also minoring in mathematics and economics  and im interested in a variety of applications of math and computer science to  you know  any sort of field that has interesting problems that can bring together a practical application and a use of my technical skill set yeah  i think so  i think  i think i have umm  i have a talent for being able to identify what motivates people  and in organizations its very easy to  you know  get caught up in whats perceived to be  you know everyones common motive that the companies supposed to be about and although the ideal framework would be nice if everyone was working indeed towards the same goal  in reality  sometimes  you know different agents  different people in the company  different people in the group have different  you know  slightly different goals for theyre in the game in the first place and i think by being able to recognize these individual motives and being able to marshal them  instead of being a destructive force towards the company  being able to marshal everyones individual talents or desires  umm  as a force that can be used to benefit the company  i think this sort of  you know  deeper  deeper attention to what people want is what  we wha wha what basically makes me be able to be a  you know  a good leader by being able to take all the resources that are provided by the team and use the parts to make a good whole sum i think yeah  i uhh  yeah  i am a team player  umm  within reason of course as long as i dont think some ridiculous demand is being made of me which is demeaning or its just  not useful in terms of  it  if theres a demand being made of me thats not fulfilled by me and my skill set  then i will  you know  defer to someone else on the team but  given that it is a demand or a request thats made that will tailor itself to my skill set  i  i think that im a team player umm  you know  for example  im more skilled at quantitative analysis than people from maybe other backgrounds  and there have been many times  you know  working on group projects and interdisciplinary crafts   where i would be asked to take on some extra role  for data analysis  just simply because i have more experience in the field and  it would be  just more beneficial to the entire to team to have someone who already has more experience to not have to enter the learning curve at the steepest point  umm  but instead to be able to produce  you know  good work pretty quickly if i were to change one one thing about myself it would umm  it would probably have to be i guess  being umm  being more mindful of my time and being a little more meticulous to make sure that all those  you know  unaccounted for minutes that past by over the course of the day  uhh  dont add up  you know into large chunks of time that are being unused i wish i had a better sense of realizing quickly when my time is not being used optimally  and freedom to actually correct that so  i  i think that for most jobs and this one as well in a very quantitative field  which does also involve  you know  leading a team of different people from various backgrounds  i think that i would be  you know  uniquely skilled for this job  because i do have a strong technical background while i can also take different parts of a team  and bring together people with  you know  they have different motives initially  into a coherent unit to get a job done thank you very much ,5.17790702821,1,ok im student mit love study electrical engineering computer science know quantitatively mind im also minoring mathematics economics im interested variety application math computer science know sort field interest problem bring together practical application use technical skill set yeah think think think talent able identify motivates people organization easy know get caught whats perceive know everyones common motive company suppose although ideal framework would nice everyone work indeed towards goal reality sometimes know different agent different people company different people group different know slightly different goal theyre game first place think able recognize individual motif able marshal instead destructive force towards company able marshal everyones individual talent desire force use benefit company think sort know deep deep attention people want wha wha basically make able know good leader able take resource provide team use part make good whole sum think yeah yeah team player within reason course long dont think ridiculous demand make demean useful term there demand make thats fulfil skill set know defer someone else team give demand request thats make tailor skill set think im team player know example im skilled quantitative analysis people maybe background many time know work group project interdisciplinary craft would ask take extra role data analysis simply experience field would beneficial entire team someone already experience enter learn curve steep point instead able produce know good work pretty quickly change one one thing would would probably guess mindful time little meticulous make sure know unaccounted minute past course day dont add know large chunk time unused wish good sense realize quickly time use optimally freedom actually correct think job one well quantitative field also involve know lead team different people various background think would know uniquely skilled job strong technical background also take different part team bring together people know different motif initially coherent unit get job do thank much
pp47,so  im a math major at mit im a junior um  specifically study  uh  applied mathematics and computer science uh  i have a focus on statistics and algorithms um  i think of myself sometimes as a leader um  definitely able to organize things and get things done when they need to be done um  ahem  im not the most organized person uh  so in some regard  i have doubt but  uh  i think ive been pretty successful in getting groups to acheive goals and that kind of thing um  so i  i think i am a team player um  i have a pretty diverse background as far as  um  cs and mathrelated kinda things go and so  um  im pretty good at working with different  uh  people from different backgrounds specifically in those fields  uh  also in other fields um  i think the particular challenge with that is being able to communicate to  uh  team members your  your ideas if  uh  theyre not exactly familiar with them sure so  i think one thing that i certainly dont like is that i tend to be very nervous um  especially when speaking in front of  uh  large groups of people and  i think definitely if i could avoid that problem  its certainly be good um  one of the things because youre always given the opportunity to talk in front of people and its  uh  whether youre presenting work or youre socializing or something  meeting new people its always something that you have to deal with and  you know  being being very sociable or being around a lot of people is certainly very helpful um  so  i think one of the reasons is that i enjoy a good challenge um  and i enjoy very challenging problems which i know that your company certainly offers um  another reason is the  my  my interests are very aligned with the companys interests  and i think that  um  both could benefit from learning  uh  especially myself  from your company and the people i work with ,4.88189890141,1,im math major mit im junior um specifically study uh apply mathematics computer science uh focus statistic algorithms um think sometimes leader um definitely able organize thing get thing do need do um ahem im organize person uh regard doubt uh think ive pretty successful get group acheive goal kind thing um think team player um pretty diverse background far um c mathrelated kinda thing go um im pretty good work different uh people different background specifically field uh also field um think particular challenge able communicate uh team member ideas uh theyre exactly familiar sure think one thing certainly dont like tend nervous um especially speak front uh large group people think definitely could avoid problem certainly good um one thing youre always give opportunity talk front people uh whether youre present work youre socialize something meet new people always something deal know sociable around lot people certainly helpful um think one reason enjoy good challenge um enjoy challenge problem know company certainly offer um another reason interest align company interest think um could benefit learn uh especially company people work
pp48,uh  well  i go to mit im a senior right now  and ill be graduating  yeah  uh  to me a leader is somebody who takes initiative  and like creates a vision when theyre given a blank slate uh  when  when i think somebody is a leader they  they dont have to be told whats done  or what needs to get done and they form the infinite choices and possibilities can quickly pick up two or three  and make a decision and also like get other people excited about it and organized hum  oh yeah obviously i do think im a team player im trying to think of an example one specific challenge the uh  for the  project you do as a senior  we had to ah  my group was in charge of analysing the materials  and we  of the section that i got asigned was  was ah  within our team we did like a self ah  splitting it up and i got like a way way heavy load  and somebodies got to really like move so it was like pretty  i didnt know if i should talk to somebody else about it or something like that and i decided like if we were going to do it as a team then were going to have to be on the same page so at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly  to never have to sleep like realistically is this like ah not going to answer things like that  uh  definitely to be more organized so a lot of time ill get like  my notes will get messy  and stuff like that organization ive been working on it  but its not where it needs to be yeah i do uh  cause i work well with other groups  and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things  and a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative  but its not like bureaucratic  so  so this is like the perfect environment  and uh  and i have like some experience in the area but more importantly like i  i figure things out and get them done like as they need to be  so people dont have to tell me what to do  or watch over me and stuff like that like its  if i want something to be accomplished like well work with a team to get it done without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever  yup ,3.70517243394,0,uh well go mit im senior right ill graduate yeah uh leader somebody take initiative like creates vision theyre give blank slate uh think somebody leader dont tell whats do need get do form infinite choice possibility quickly pick two three make decision also like get people excite organize hum oh yeah obviously think im team player im try think example one specific challenge uh project senior ah group charge analyse material section get asigned ah within team like self ah split get like way way heavy load somebody get really like move like pretty didnt know talk somebody else something like decide like go team go page meeting make sure split little evenly never sleep like realistically like ah go answer thing like uh definitely organize lot time ill get like note get messy stuff like organization ive work need yeah uh cause work well group job require like small group work together accomplish thing small group like perfect environment work collaborative like bureaucratic like perfect environment uh like experience area importantly like figure thing get do like need people dont tell watch stuff like like want something accomplish like well work team get do without like somebody tell watch whatever yup
pp49,good its been a tough week uhm  my name is inaudible i am junior in course 20 which is biological engineering i come from puerto rico and ive been learning a bit more this past year about what i actually want to do in life right now my main goals are set more towards the medicine side of bioengineering so medical devices  biomaterials  tissue engineering  drug delivery  its what  its what interests me right now uh its not set right now thats why i am also tending to go to different research opportunities and different uh pharmaceutical internships and well see what happens from there on and ill be able to focus on one actual path per say  so i think i am leader because i like planning things i like to gather all the information i have  all the resources i have  and all the uh basically either group uh all the group inaudible or each contribution from each person  gather them all up and come up with an efficient plan to tackle said problem  or homework  or project  or presentation whichever may be the case i tend to make people give more than i make them give more than 100 of what the  they  they  the bar that they set themselves at so i feel if i feel that somebody has potential i can notice it and at the same time work with a person to basically exploit that potential to a new maximum at the same way i feel that i am very open to constructive criticism  if somebody feels that i am not doing a great job i am very happy just to sit with them and learn from that experience because its gonna make me more efficient in the future so i feel that just having a set plan from the start to tackle problems  and at the same way editing it and adapting it to every new situation or the feelings of the people you are basically  uh overseeing then thats  uh  a very good approach to everything that we do  so  uh  teams have been uh very large aspect of my life ever since high school ive been a part of the soccer team i continue to do that now ive been part of the debate team  and honor society which had its own team for competitions but i feel that the biggest challenge right now has been when i am with a team of people that are seniors to me so they  they are better prepared  much better informed  and have an arsenal of skills that i have yet to acquire because i just dont have the same level of experience that they have so if i am sophomore  and ive been grouped with seniors and juniors of my subject of engineering class  the difference is very noticeable the difference of level and performance is very noticeable and i try to  basically  give what i can  but i also want to excel at what i can actually move forward to so if i feel that i can actually contribute much more than what theyre expecting of me  because if i dont have that level of experience what i want to do is get to that level so i gotta work harder  push through and get to this level thats basically at the same level as the rest of the group so ill try to work with people  and ill try to find someone who mentor me through that process and step by step  because the biggest challenge for me  is being alone and tackling it straight  ill use the other group members  ill readily approach them and ask for help because thats what the group is for the team succeeds together all the way so thats i go i would say  doubting doubting myself  doubting the things i do  doubting the decisions i make i would like to have absolutely no regrets  or if i have them learn something from them i am sometimes am fairly a safe player  so i calculate the risks before i see the return so im not a great fan of plunging in into something that i dont know  thats high risk  high return i like to play it safe  and have a thing to fall back on the same way it works for problems  it works for personal life  it works for basically everything thats surrounds me i feel that its been changing  with every new experience ive been passing through leaving home  college outside of puerto rico  but i still feel that ill rarely benefit of just letting go  and taking more of a risk than i normally do the first one that pops right into mind is bioengineering so ive always been naturally curious about things ive always had  a drive behind everything i do  so i got into bioengineering right after i saw that i had this opportunity coming to mit  and coming from a family that has been effected by a lot of cancer  i found that doing this i could actually benefit my family  benefit other peoples families that have been effected by it ive been going through some really tough times with grandmothers  and other family members that have survived and succumbed to it and from there my motivation has been always to push forward no matter what the challenge so when i step into a lab  i see what i have in front of me  the ultimate goal might be the farthest goal in my life  i may never reach it but rest assured that i will do my best to contribute to its forward movement i will always try and leave it at a better place than it was before  and if i am not the one to reach it  another person will but i will be sure that i actually contributed to it ,3.60251698209,0,good tough week name inaudible junior course biological engineering come puerto rico ive learning bit past year actually want life right main goal set towards medicine side bioengineering medical device biomaterials tissue engineering drug delivery interest right uh set right thats also tend go different research opportunity different uh pharmaceutical internship well see happens ill able focus one actual path per say think leader like plan thing like gather information resource uh basically either group uh group inaudible contribution person gather come efficient plan tackle say problem homework project presentation whichever may case tend make people give make give bar set feel feel somebody potential notice time work person basically exploit potential new maximum way feel open constructive criticism somebody feel great job happy sit learn experience gon na make efficient future feel set plan start tackle problem way edit adapt every new situation feeling people basically uh oversee thats uh good approach everything uh team uh large aspect life ever since high school ive part soccer team continue ive part debate team honor society team competition feel big challenge right team people senior well prepare much good inform arsenal skill yet acquire dont level experience sophomore ive group senior junior subject engineering class difference noticeable difference level performance noticeable try basically give also want excel actually move forward feel actually contribute much theyre expect dont level experience want get level get ta work harder push get level thats basically level rest group ill try work people ill try find someone mentor process step step big challenge alone tackle straight ill use group member ill readily approach ask help thats group team succeed together way thats go would say doubt doubt doubt thing doubt decision make would like absolutely regret learn something sometimes fairly safe player calculate risk see return im great fan plunge something dont know thats high risk high return like play safe thing fall back way work problem work personal life work basically everything thats surround feel change every new experience ive passing leave home college outside puerto rico still feel ill rarely benefit let go take risk normally first one pop right mind bioengineering ive always naturally curious thing ive always drive behind everything get bioengineering right saw opportunity come mit come family effect lot cancer find could actually benefit family benefit people family effect ive go really tough time grandmother

pp5,alright so  my background  im a junior at mit studying computer science and  umm  ive also done research in the computer science field umm  i interned  er  i researched with a group at mit and what we did was we made an interactive game to  uh  to teach and ive also had some experience  uh  internship at  uh  at google i think im a leader i do believe i have leadership  uh  qualities and that  and i can support this because ive been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus and when i have had the responsibilities ive carried them out  uh  very well and ive been able to overcome challenges such as umm  one of the groups im  uh  on the executive board of expedited access to standard education umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group and i took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past oh  well i definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh  my participation in my team in are student association and for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish  i was in charge and i thought id give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that i set  so  um  as leader to be responsible for that task  i tried to figure out what was going on in the other students lives because i was getting context and uh  understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didnt have a lot of tests or homework that week and through that  ahem  through that understanding i was able to  um  help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict one thing about myself interesting if i was given the option to change one thing about myself  yes what i would change is to  uh  i guess  uh  just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than i  than a person at my level would  you know  at this kind of level  and thats umm  thats something that would be nice you know i feel like i would be able to be uh  much further along in my career than i am now uh huh  yeah well i think i should get the job because i  um  have the skills necessary to complete the  the task that ill be assigned um im very motivated  im always willing to learn and i  im very passionate about learning and uh  i think ill be able to learn a lot through the position  as well as contribute to the position and be able to  um  influence the people that i work directly with or that are shareholders in my project ,5.4271945507,1,alright background im junior mit study computer science ive also do research computer science field intern er research group mit make interactive game uh teach ive also experience uh internship uh google think im leader believe leadership uh quality support ive leadership position organization campus responsibility ive carry uh well ive able overcome challenge one group im uh executive board expedite access standard education one task semester come idea presentation carry control show another group take complete ownership come pretty well able raise money past oh well definitely would consider team player example would uh participation team student association one task try accomplish charge think id give task member lot task get complete deadline set um leader responsible task tried figure go student live get context uh understand miss deadline didnt lot test homework week ahem understand able um help motivate complete task resolve conflict one thing interest give option change one thing yes would change uh guess uh generally lot knowledge field person level would know kind level thats thats something would nice know feel like would able uh much along career uh huh yeah well think get job um skill necessary complete task ill assign um im motivate im always willing learn im passionate learn uh think ill able learn lot position well contribute position able um influence people work directly shareholder project
pp50,very well  thanks my backgrounduh  i have a fiarly technical background i went to a fairly technical high school um  i have mainly a mathematics and physics background with also some computer science uh  i also  i have been involved in leadership  uh  outside of  outside of academics so then in high school i was  uh  captain of my chess team  and i also served as president of a couple of clubs in high school so i have some  some experience in that regard like i said  mainly i have a pretty quantitative technical background and  uh  with some sprinkling of other stuff as well yes  i think so  because i typically think using my own mind and i act on those decisions rather than listening to whatuh  i mean  of course  i take into account what i think it was lincoln who said that  uh  you should take into account what people tell you but then make your own decision he said it more elaborately  but those are the essence of what he was saying  and i try to  i try to  to use that in every day life and in  also in  like important projects i would say that  and i  i usually have  im usually pretty successful in convincing people that my way is right when it is um  yeah  i think so uh  when its a matter of ideology i dont like to make compromises  but when its a matter of  uh  getting stuff done  i think that i  i think that i am a team player i think that uh  usually im   im willing to  to make sacrifices if necessary for the ultimate goal and so  for example  uh  one time in high school  uh  we had a group project  and one of the member  i mean  it was more complicated than im making it  but the gist of it was that one of the members who was responsible for our data analysis  he fell short  he  uh  he  we found out pretty late  uh  just a few days before the presentation  that he had misdone most of the data analysis  and as a result  the rest of us  but especially me  because it was a group of four  and we were kind of divided into two  him and me  and then subdivided into ones so he and i were kind of a subgroup of a larger group and so i was more responsible for what he had done than the other two were so it was mainly me  with some help from the other two we had to put in a lot of work in those last few days  especially me i had to fix that and try to get it  you know  get it functional before the presentation was due one thing about myself i guess maybe being  uh  being more decisive on incomplete information i have a tendency to try to make  to try to get almost perfect information before i commit a hundred percent to a decision  and  of course  thats never  thats not always possible  and so i do  i mean i do  of course  make decisions based on imperfect information every day you have to  otherwise you wouldnt survive but i feel that  you know  if there is a spectrum of  of how decisive youre willing to be based on a certain amount of information  i think the ideal place that i would like to be is a little further toward the  the decisive on incomplete information end than where i am right now  so  i would shift that a little bit ok umm  i mean  lets go with quantitative trading  trading well i think i have the necessary skill set  and the  and the  not the personality  maybe well personality  but more the  uh  so in terms of skill set  you know  it takes a very quantitative mathematical background with the ability to implement stuff  uh  to program and so on  and i have all of that it takes a lot of modelling skills i have that  mathematical modelling and what not it also requires you to be a   very competitive  which i have been  and b  to be willing to  you know  to go through hell for  for certain periods of time when youre either up next to a deadline or something unexpected happens and so it requires you to be able to  to vary the amount of time you put in  usually ill opt for the higher  uh for an increased amount of time  a significant bit from the average  so i  and i think i have a lot of experience doing that and its something that ive shown i can handle ,5.60457267794,1,well thanks backgrounduh fiarly technical background go fairly technical high school um mainly mathematics physic background also computer science uh also involved leadership uh outside outside academic high school uh captain chess team also serve president couple club high school experience regard like say mainly pretty quantitative technical background uh sprinkle stuff well yes think typically think use mind act decision rather listen whatuh mean course take account think lincoln say uh take account people tell make decision say elaborately essence say try try use every day life also like important project would say usually im usually pretty successful convince people way right um yeah think uh matter ideology dont like make compromise matter uh get stuff do think think team player think uh usually im im willing make sacrifice necessary ultimate goal example uh one time high school uh group project one member mean complicate im make gist one member responsible data analysis fell short uh find pretty late uh day presentation misdone data analysis result rest u especially group four kind divide two subdivided one kind subgroup large group responsible do two mainly help two put lot work last day especially fix try get know get functional presentation due one thing guess maybe uh decisive incomplete information tendency try make try get almost perfect information commit hundred percent decision course thats never thats always possible mean course make decision base imperfect information every day otherwise wouldnt survive feel know spectrum decisive youre willing base certain amount information think ideal place would like little toward decisive incomplete information end right would shift little bit ok mean let go quantitative trading trading well think necessary skill set personality maybe well personality uh term skill set know take quantitative mathematical background ability implement stuff uh program take lot model skill mathematical modelling also require competitive b willing know go hell certain period time youre either next deadline something unexpected happen require able vary amount time put usually ill opt high uh increase amount time significant bit average think lot experience something ive show handle
pp52,um  well im from florida  i was born in miami  my  uh  parents are fromim  uh  south korean by ethnicity  id say im more american by heritage but uh  my  um  parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down  and around  i was born  like around 90s i was born here in florida  i had all my schooling in florida  i went to home school until 7th grade then private school until i graduated  thats a brief synopsis of my background i think i am  uh  just because  um  i have seniority maybe through sports or if its fromi feel like its hard for people not to be leaders especially when youre um  assigned to do group work or youre assigned to do goal setting  i feel like if youre in any  uh  situation where youre doing goal setting youre being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them  and how you tell  like  youre telling yourself  how am i gonna get this done  so like  basically youre self leading  i believe  um  maybe id say through sports i was probably a leader  by  um  me being the upperclassman  i led my teammates on  so id say  yeah  ive been a leader  uh  yes  um  so  seeing how i rowed four years  i think the biggest conflict was um  when  um  junior year i was rowing for junior eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals  and the last  pentameter of the terameter sp race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals that was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing  especially because thats something i spent four hours a day  six days a week on for my entire senior  um  high school career and that twas something i was going to carry over through to college  and what really um  made me realize was that yes  like  that was a big mistake  it was just  honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it werent for some people  if it werent for just me  just being  just taking and it and just maturing from it  i think thats like  what it takes  if you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it  you can still push something onto the table  like  um  last  last  year and still work hard to  to really fight through it  you can really become great  and um  i feel like thats what i was really working to change my view on that and um  in the end we  um  we medaled  we  uh  were runner ups in states  we medaled  so  i think that was a  good  good conflict that i resolved i wish  i wishif i could change one thing about myself i think it would be me being  i think  more proactive to do something  id say  i wish i was morei wish i was could  i wish i was a little bit more volatile in things i chose  actually  because i feel like um  i stuck to just doing crew in high school and i thought that was great but i was wondering  like  i wondered what would happen to me if i tried different  more than one thing  i know  i know like its good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field  but i always wondered  i always wondered like  what would happen if i pursued more toward research or more towards um  club activities  that way i could have like  a more wellrounded high school experience one right now or just well  i think i should have this job mainly because i find that im well with groups  i work very well with groups  at the same time when you push me to do tasks myself im able to do the same amount  be just as productive  i feel like  um  as an applicant being subject to group work and individual work  um  there should be no difference in how i should produce something in group work in individual work  i should be just as creative and innovative if i was working myself or if i was spending time working with a group of people  so  i feel like if i was going to get this job  um  it would help greatly for the people id be working with and for myself   ,3.4167546091,0,um well im florida bear miami uh parent fromim uh south korean ethnicity id say im american heritage uh um parent come around settle around born like around born florida school florida go home school th grade private school graduate thats brief synopsis background think uh um seniority maybe sport fromi feel like hard people leader especially youre um assign group work youre assign goal set feel like youre uh situation youre goal set youre leader put task execute tell like youre tell gon na get do like basically youre self lead believe um maybe id say sport probably leader um upperclassman lead teammate id say yeah ive leader uh yes um see row four year think big conflict um um junior year row junior eight national grand final last pentameter terameter sp race oar pop end actually go third place dead last grand final possibly hard experience make really reevaluate meant row especially thats something spend four hour day six day week entire senior um high school career twas something go carry college really um make realize yes like big mistake honestly could happen anyone werent people werent take mature think thats like take go something really bad get strong still push something onto table like um last last year still work hard really fight really become great um feel like thats really work change view um end um medaled uh runner ups state medaled think good good conflict resolve wish wishif could change one thing think would think proactive something id say wish morei wish could wish little bit volatile thing choose actually feel like um stick crew high school think great wonder like wonder would happen tried different one thing know know like good people stick one thing grow field always wonder always wonder like would happen pursue toward research towards um club activity way could like wellrounded high school experience one right well think job mainly find im well group work well group time push task im able amount productive feel like um applicant subject group work individual work um difference produce something group work individual work creative innovative work spending time work group people feel like go get job um would help greatly people id work
pp53,im fine how are you  uhmm  so  i was born in uh  nigeria uh  and i actually came  over to the united states when i was 8 years old but uh  i remember science  math  math and science were always my best subjects uhm and i really enjoy anatomy  human anatomy uhm  so i think thats when i started thinking about medical field leftright  i do beleive im a leader uhm  i do beleive i take initiative a lot uhm  one example that is uhm one of the student groups that i work with  i work with several actually  but one of uhm  an example from one  the one that i work um  yes i do beleive im a team player uh  another student that i work with  i work with several that i can mention uhm  are black student union and im on the executive board of  for the second time this year  uhm if i was given one option to change one thing about myself  uh  i think it would be my hesitation uhm  im pretty hesitant uhm about you know uhm  first ideas or initial thoughts that i have uhm i like always have to seek like a second opinion i think i should get into medical school  uhm  because i do believe that i will make a good doctor um  im a people person i love helping people um  and i love kids um i love seeing um i guess their resilience when it comes to  ,4.72087043474,1,im fine uhmm bear uh nigeria uh actually come united state year old uh remember science math math science always best subject really enjoy anatomy human anatomy think thats start think medical field leftright beleive im leader beleive take initiative lot one example one student group work work several actually one example one one work um yes beleive im team player uh another student work work several mention black student union im executive board second time year give one option change one thing uh think would hesitation im pretty hesitant know first ideas initial thought like always seek like second opinion think get medical school believe make good doctor um im people person love help people um love kid um love see um guess resilience come
pp55,yeah  sure ummm  im great thank you ok well i am a math major  but i have a lot of background in kind of different areas so freshman year i did some work  um  at the department of energy  um  working the cfos office so im getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices then i kinda branched more towards cs aspects  so  i did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also  um  for companies ummm  definitely so im president of the undergrad society of learner math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to  um  kind of help underclassmen and  also  younger girls  so those in highschool  middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events  even networking things  so  uh  anything with companies but also research with professors its a great way to kind of help other people who havent really seen those opportunities yet yeah  soum  last winter i was working in the boston area at autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up um   i dont know how much familiarity you have with  um  coding like repository systems  but  basically if someone  um  uploads like their work to the server and it doesnt work basically everyone elses stuff doesnt work either so theres like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people so every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyones work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code so it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake  i guess i would probably try to ask more questions um  in general if i get directions which are really broad where i dont know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around i guess it would be good to get more like to the point um like i mentioned before i think i have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities in addition to this i am pretty qualified i believe in terms of my academic classes that i have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated i have a deep passion for math and aside from that  i have many internships which have honed my skills in the work place ,5.5121846745,1,yeah sure ummm im great thank ok well math major lot background kind different area freshman year work um department energy um work cfo office im get kind feel budget um also risk matrix kinda branch towards cs aspect bite cod research aspect also um company ummm definitely im president undergrad society learner math basically give great opportunity um kind help underclassman also young girl highschool middle school kind get become active math community um participate event even network thing uh anything company also research professor great way kind help people havent really see opportunity yet yeah soum last winter work boston area autotegrity like online market start um dont know much familiarity um cod like repository system basically someone um uploads like work server doesnt work basically everyone elses stuff doesnt work either theres like little column button type thing rebuild call blame button could kind blame people every would occur someone would screw code would make everyones work stop instead know blame one person tell fix code would kind look go wrong could improve upon instead fix one person code kind group effort see much could improve one mistake guess would probably try ask question um general get direction really broad dont know start search um instead ask high would probably automatically start look everything start float around guess would good get like point um like mention think good combination leadership skills well um team player ability addition pretty qualify believe term academic class take also extracurriculars demonstrated deep passion math aside many internship hone skill work place
pp56,im good  how are you um  im currently a junior at mit studying biology im interested in going to medical school  so im hoping to apply to medical school my senior year  and then matriculate the next year um  yeah um  i think im a leader i have a lot of leadership positions  so  currently i am the president of the student group at mit called the american medical student association  so  uh  i help organize a lot of events for premeds at mit  um  so as a premed i feel there arent very many resources  um  for premeds we have a premed advising office  but  um  most students at mit end up going into like  engineering or research  not very many go into medicine so  um  we provide a lot of  um  outside activities for premeds uh  our main one is  um  lecture series  so we often ask doctors from nearby hospitals to come speak about  like  what they do sure  um  so  um  as part of the american medical student association  uh  last year we started a brand new event  um  it was a 5k run to benefit the austins childrens hospital and since it was our first time planning such a large event we had a lot of trouble  um  like  communicating between team members and distributing um  what  like clearly stating what each person should do  and what their responsibilities were um  to fix that i think we had to like  i had to call  like  an executive meeting so  we have an exec board and then  uh  i made sure that everyone knew clearly what they were supposed to do  and made sure they finished what they had to do by a certain date hmm  thats tough laughter um  i think the main thing i would try to change is  um  getting nervous in front of strangers or being shy  um  i used to  um  get really shy when  like  public speaking for example  speaking in front of a lot of people  and ive been trying to improve that um  but  i think it would be nice if i could be more  but like  there is still room for improvement uh  my passion is helping people so  i have a lot of  ive been doing a lot of volunteer activities  um  ive been volunteering at hospitals  ive been volunteering at brooks  i bring them to the womens hospital in boston  and meps general hospital ive also been volunteering through the cambridge community centers  i used to tutor young children how to read  and im currently an ap biology teacher for  um  students in the boston area  who want to take ap biology  but cant um  so  i really enjoy helping people  uh  and i think medicine is one of the best ways to help people because everyone gets sick and  uh  i mean once your health is gone you cant really do anything  so ,4.89659331096,1,im good um im currently junior mit study biology im interested go medical school im hop apply medical school senior year matriculate next year um yeah um think im leader lot leadership position currently president student group mit call american medical student association uh help organize lot event premeds mit um premed feel arent many resource um premeds premed advise office um student mit end go like engineering research many go medicine um provide lot um outside activity premeds uh main one um lecture series often ask doctor nearby hospital come speak like sure um um part american medical student association uh last year start brand new event um k run benefit austin childrens hospital since first time plan large event lot trouble um like communicate team member distribute um like clearly state person responsibility um fix think like call like executive meeting exec board uh make sure everyone know clearly suppose make sure finish certain date hmm thats tough laughter um think main thing would try change um get nervous front stranger shy um use um get really shy like public speak example speak front lot people ive try improve um think would nice could like still room improvement uh passion help people lot ive lot volunteer activity um ive volunteering hospital ive volunteer brook bring woman hospital boston meps general hospital ive also volunteer cambridge community center use tutor young child read im currently ap biology teacher um student boston area want take ap biology cant um really enjoy help people uh think medicine one best way help people everyone get sick uh mean health go cant really anything
pp57,im doing very well today  thanks  how are you im currently a junior here at mit and im pursing a double major in computer science and management um the reason for that is that i actually fell in love with um the merging of computer science with a lot of other fields and i found that management is a way to take computer science and the theories of algorithms and problem solving and taking it to a wider field which is exactly why im interested in consulting is again its the idea of taking problem solving and algorithms and applying it to a lot of different problems and always trying new things and im very excited about that and thats where im coming from  i do  um  im actually a part of the gordan engineering leadership program here at mit  which students are chosen through an application  process to be a part of this program  and in this program um  we work on engineering leadership labs which is um  they give us scenarios which we might encounter in the real world and we take the position of a leader and kind of get to step through it  and ive gotten very positive feedback from my group every time about how ive handled those  in addition  in um various activities im involved in on campus i have had a leadership role in many of those and again ive gotten very positive feedback from the people ive worked with so i think those put together mean not only have i had the experience to be a leader but ive also had positive feedback that i am succeeding at that definitely  um  i was on the committee that designed our class ring so at mit each year theres a new class ring designed specifically for that year and the idea is that it encoencompasses aspects of all different fractions of student life so this committee is made up of a very diverse group of people  and um  there were some features on the ring which we would become very divided on and there few ah divisions within campus which kind of became clear on our team  so people would kind of polarize based on which side of the campus fraction they lived on and then it would kind of get a little bit hostile  and people would say this is relevant  no its not relevant  um and i kind of became the peace keeper um where i would kind of go between those sides try to find the mutually agreeable thing maybe like if someone really wanted something on the ring and someone else didnt i would suggest maybe we could make it smaller or have it somewhere else so if it was on the ring but not so blatantly obvious that the people who didnt relate to it thought it was too focal  so i became kind of the unofficial go between who would hear both sides kind of impartially and put things togetherand i had about 2 to 3 people afterwards tell me that we wouldnt have gotten to where we did without my peacekeeping  i think i would know my limits a little bit better um  in that sense i  like i mentioned with the computer science and management i get excited in a lot of different areas and i really want to try doing everything that excites me and i really give it my all  but as a result being involved with a lot of different things means that at times i very tired because im trying to do a lot so i think i would recognize when im hitting that point and scale back a little bit um that said  ive been trying to work on that a bit this year and kind of pick my top activities and cut down to those so it is something im working on i think aside from my background which is as i mentioned very ah relevant to consulting with the library and gym applications  um as weve talked about im very much a team player  im very excited about the work that you do um  i absolutely love all the different aspects  ive talked to a lot of people in the company and ive really liked what theyve said about the company culture  it makes me very excited and those are all values i struggle and relate to  so in addition to the expertise i think i would be a great fit ,6.42801315315,1,im well today thanks im currently junior mit im purse double major computer science management um reason actually fell love um merge computer science lot field find management way take computer science theory algorithms problem solve take wide field exactly im interested consult idea take problem solve algorithms apply lot different problem always try new thing im excited thats im come um im actually part gordan engineering leadership program mit student choose application process part program program um work engineering leadership labs um give u scenario might encounter real world take position leader kind get step ive gotten positive feedback group every time ive handle addition um various activity im involve campus leadership role many ive gotten positive feedback people ive work think put together mean experience leader ive also positive feedback succeed definitely um committee design class ring mit year theres new class ring design specifically year idea encoencompasses aspect different fraction student life committee make diverse group people um feature ring would become divided ah division within campus kind become clear team people would kind polarize base side campus fraction live would kind get little bit hostile people would say relevant relevant um kind become peace keeper um would kind go side try find mutually agreeable thing maybe like someone really want something ring someone else didnt would suggest maybe could make small somewhere else ring blatantly obvious people didnt relate thought focal become kind unofficial go would hear side kind impartially put thing togetherand people afterwards tell wouldnt get without peacekeeping think would know limit little bit well um sense like mention computer science management get excite lot different area really want try everything excite really give result involve lot different thing mean time tired im try lot think would recognize im hit point scale back little bit um say ive try work bit year kind pick top activity cut something im work think aside background mention ah relevant consult library gym application um weve talk im much team player im excite work um absolutely love different aspect ive talk lot people company ive really like theyve say company culture make excited value struggle relate addition expertise think would great fit
pp58,good i study ocean engineering at mit  im a junior and im really interested in building robots to use in the ocean  like  this summer i worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in antarctica   yes  i believe im a leader  right now  um  one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the society of naval architects submarine engineers at mit  and thats a group of all the ocean engineers studying at mit including undergrads and gradstudents  and  um  im working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with  with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments yes  id say im a team player  uhm  this  this term im working on a team for one of my classes a team of about seven people and were building  er  manufacturing a hundred yoyos together and  um  its actually complicated to manufacture one yoyo if youre doing everything from scratch like the molds  the plastic  the process times  you figuring out which missions you want to use  and  um  weve done a yoyo  we decided to divide our team into  um  groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yoyo so we have four parts  and we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yoyos but two teams hadnt finished their part yet because they couldnt  um  get time in the mission shop  so we decided to resolve that by  we talked to the professor  i was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening  uhm  we got the extention  and anyway  if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then  the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week lets see  sometimes  i would like to be more comfortable with my voice  like speaking louder and more confidently   sometimes  like when i go back home i pick up this southern accent again  my family lives in dc  but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when i came home for thanksgiving i had this southern twang  oh  it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then i went into this middle stage  now im back to where i am now  maybe speaking a little bit more quieter  but without the accent  so i need to find out where my voice is   uhm  i am a really hard worker  im very organized  im comfortable working with teams  im also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that im involved on  um  im passionate about what i do and i can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group ,4.96176767423,1,good study ocean engineering mit im junior im really interested build robot use ocean like summer work underwater vehicle look sea ice antarctica yes believe im leader right um one main leadership initiative restart society naval architect submarine engineer mit thats group ocean engineer study mit include undergrads gradstudents um im work student organize dinner professor out student interested engineering school department yes id say im team player term im work team one class team seven people build er manufacturing hundred yoyos together um actually complicate manufacture one yoyo youre everything scratch like mold plastic process time figure mission want use um weve do yoyo decide divide team um group two people set two people work one part yoyo four part problem last week need fill report yoyos two team hadnt finish part yet couldnt um get time mission shop decide resolve talk professor person talk professor ask extension report tell happen get extention anyway write report except miss information two part team work two part go fill week let see sometimes would like comfortable voice like speak louder confidently sometimes like go back home pick southern accent family live dc lot south speak twang come home thanksgiving southern twang oh sound different people little bit confused go middle stage im back maybe speak little bit quieter without accent need find voice really hard worker im organize im comfortable work team im also seal team another part team im involve um im passionate bring lot engineering expertise knowledge group
pp59,great  hahaha more about my backround  well im from canada  but i grew up in south florida because  you know  one day my parents just decided that it was too cold interviewer laughs so they literally just decided to pick up and move uhh  so i basically lived there my whole life until i decided to come here for school  and  you know  since then ive just been going through mit im trying to do a lot of premed things i like to volunteer uhhh  you know  strong family values  things like that so yes because  umm  everything i try to do  i  you know  always try to do the best that i can  and  even if im not the best at it  that the effort  like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody  even if theyre better at it than i am  you know i find thats inspiring  you know  seeing someone try  you know  and trying their hardest and maybe theyre not the best at it but  you know  the effort that they put into something  is sort of something to be looked high upon  so hushed laughter umm  sure sooo  basically almost every night when you go home to problem set you know  problems sets here are sort of designed to be group efforts  at least in chemical engineering they are  and often you and your group are working and you come to a crossroads  you know  part of the group thinks you should go one wan and part of the gorup things we should go another way and  you know  kind of something that ive learned is that you cant shut down other peoples ideas umm  so  i think something really important to do is we end up trying both ways  and maybe it takes us a little blt more effot  and maybe it takes us a little bit longer  but then we know for sure  like  you know  okay  this way definitely didnt work  and you know maybe this way is the better way to go but at least we didnt just  you know  diverge one way  and think like oh  maybe we should have done it another way  so i think thats pretty important umm  hmmm i wish i was taller both laugh you know  sometimes  i guess i always think that  you know  im right  and  you know  it takes people some convincing and ii know im definitely not right all the time but i think thats kind of  you know  like  human nature  like  noone ever wants to think that theyre wrong   but  uhh  you know something ive learned here is  heh  ha  because ive been working my but off both laugh umm  you know  its just something that im very passionate about im really  not i would do it for free  like im  you know people say they want to do medicine for the money  or you know  cause its a highpower career  but you know   its the only type of thing and that i see myself being satisfied with in a longterm career its i love being part of  like  the medical community right now  you know  if its my work between being an emt  working at the hospital you know  working as a tech these are all things that i would love and i would do im happy to wake up in the morning and go do these things  and  you know  i wanna say its like my burning passion like  it is  you know  my drive and  you know  i think thats probably the most important thing when youre looking for a candidate for medical school or for a job umm  its knowing that  you know  theyre not gonna  you know  one day decide that they dont wanna do this anymore  and theyre not kind of like yeah  im not sure if i wanna go to med school its like  no  ive been wanting to do this since i was like  nine years old  and every single thing ive done to work my way towards it its just made me fall in love with it even more ,4.80223590513,1,great hahaha backround well im canada grow south florida know one day parent decide cold interviewer laugh literally decide pick move basically live whole life decide come school know since ive go mit im try lot premed thing like volunteer uhhh know strong family value thing like yes everything try know always try best even im best effort like alone enough sort inspire somebody even theyre well know find thats inspire know see someone try know try hard maybe theyre best know effort put something sort something look high upon hush laughter sure sooo basically almost every night go home problem set know problem set sort design group effort least chemical engineering often group work come crossroad know part group think go one wan part gorup thing go another way know kind something ive learn cant shut people idea think something really important end try way maybe take u little blt effot maybe take u little bit longer know sure like know okay way definitely didnt work know maybe way well way go least didnt know diverge one way think like oh maybe do another way think thats pretty important hmmm wish taller laugh know sometimes guess always think know im right know take people convince ii know im definitely right time think thats kind know like human nature like noone ever want think theyre wrong know something ive learn heh ha ive work laugh know something im passionate im really would free like im know people say want medicine money know cause highpower career know type thing see satisfied longterm career love part like medical community right know work emt work hospital know work tech thing would love would im happy wake morning go thing know wan na say like burn passion like know drive know think thats probably important thing youre look candidate medical school job know know theyre gon na know one day decide dont wan na anymore theyre kind like yeah im sure wan na go med school like ive want since like nine year old every single thing ive do work way towards make fall love even
pp6,um  so  i was born in japan  um  where i lived for seven years after that  i moved to uh the us when i was around seven or eight years old uh  first to michigan for a couple of years  from two to three  and then to maryland um and it was in maryland that i started middle school and  it was through middle school and high school that i was exposed to above average and advanced courses in science  math  and uh programming i was competing with i think the best in the state  and probably best in the nation  taking math competitions  just doing a lot of science competitions in general um  junior year of high school  uh  because of peer and parental pressures  i decided to go into premed and i decided to take  consequently decided to take some bio classes  uh  a lot of cell physiology  genetics  psychology and when i got here at mit  uh well logically i decided to major in course twenty  bio engineering um  and to just to follow that track i decided to take a couple  decided to do a couple internships in labs  four labs actually  two in academia here at mit actually and i realized that uh the positions werent fast paced and werent competitive enough or quantitative enough for that matter  so i decided to go into industry hoping that would satisfy my requirements  i guess and again it was fun  i learned a lot  but it was just uh it didnt have the skill set requirements that i wanted uh but it was um my last internship i had the opportunity to talk with several directors  managers  people on the business side  i realized that could be something that i want to do that could be more appropriate for me  for my career um  afterward i talked to a lot of my finance colleagues  started taking finance classes  went to workshops  started networking  and i realized  you know  this is most likely what i want to do i talked to several people who wanted to go into trading and they gave me some interview questions and i said you know what  thats exactly the kind of questions that i want to tackle on a daily basis and so thats why im here do i think im a leader i believe so and this is  i say so because of several reasons one is from  just from personal experience in the past ive uh worked in teams  ive met teams  a few in high school and a few in college  and i think i work well with others but not only that  people trust me i am able to divide up a huge project  break it down into small subprojects and uh give  assign these tasks to different people without uh any complaints  without too much complaints i think i have some leaderships skills  uh as you can see from my resume if inaudible mumbling i do consider myself a team player id like to give a good example in my sophomore year in high school  i worked with this project called mission impossible  or mission possible  sorry  and the goal of the project was to design a rover from scratch  that would traverse a platform and record data  send it over to the computer  and the computer will create a 3d graph  a 3d replica of the terrain and we were graded on how precise and accurate  how similar the 3d terrain was to the actual terrain and there were many parts to the project  one was the construction of the actual rover the other was the programming making us write the source code third one was making the terrain the forth one was integrating everything together there were five group members  there were only four tasks i was picked to be  i guess the group leader  so i assigned the tasks i made sure everything integrated correctly and  its not a small task  but uh  it definitely gave me some experience i think one of the problems was  because this was a four week long project  this was a four week long project  but we didnt get much done until the third or forth week  because things just didnt integrate correctly there werent communications  there werent assigned tasks  there just wasnt teamwork there just wasnt the synergy that was required for us in order for us to finish this project and during the third week i was appointed the captain  i gave tasks i made sure every part was compatible i made sure that everybody knew what everybody else was doing  and in the end we completed the project successfully well  as you can see from my resume  my biggest weakness i think is my lack of formal training in finance uh  im not a course fifteen finance or management major  or a course fourteen economics major i dont have any form of work experience  i dont work in a big bank or investment company or a proprietary trading firm but  i can tell you  that i have taken more initiative  ive been more proactive in the last year in terms of looking for ways to combat  to overcome my weakness ive gone to network sessions  ive actually set up to quit my sports team so i could go to these network sections  info sessions  workshops  because unfortunately team practice was always between five and seven and that was also the period in which info sessions were held i did my research  ive gone online and went to your company website  i know exactly who you guys and what youre looking for  i know exactly what my role will be i dont have any false expectations about my job and  after knowing everything  i am still very very very interested in the position well  i  i think my answer to the past question about uh how i overcame at my weakness how one of my strength is  my quantitative competitive and fast paced abilities  and the fact that i dont have any false expectations  i know exactly what i want to do  i know exactly what you want from me and  those are very good reasons  like they apply to this and i would also like to compare myself with the rest competition and tell you that i have more  i dont think theres anybody else with the same kind of technical strength  technical expertise that i have  um  even uh most students here at mit ,4.39897096422,0,um bear japan um live seven year move uh u around seven eight year old uh first michigan couple year two three maryland um maryland start middle school middle school high school expose average advanced course science math uh program compete think best state probably best nation

genetics psychology get mit uh well logically decide major course twenty bio engineering um follow track decide take couple decide couple internship labs four lab actually two academia mit actually realize uh position werent fast paced werent competitive enough quantitative enough matter decide go industry hop would satisfy requirement guess fun learn lot uh didnt skill set requirement want uh um last internship opportunity talk several director manager people business side realize could something want could appropriate career um afterward talk lot finance colleague start take finance class go workshop start network realize know likely want talk several people want go trading give interview question say know thats exactly kind question want tackle daily basis thats im think im leader believe say several reason one personal experience past ive uh work team ive meet team high school college think work well others people trust able divide huge project break small subprojects uh give assign task different people without uh complaint without much complaint think leadership skill uh see resume inaudible mumbling consider team player id like give good example sophomore year high school work project call mission impossible mission possible sorry goal project design rover scratch would traverse platform record data send computer computer create graph replica terrain grade

pp60,good how are you um  so  im a junior at mit studying computer science and molecular biology um  most of my background is in biology i did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at mit  in just basic molecular biology um  but  im also involved in a couple student groups on campus one of them  i was previously involved in mit fighting world hunger  so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues and  right now ive devoted all of my time to a different organization called globemed at mit  and we basically  our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve hiv healthcare services in togo  which is in africa most people dont know where that is  so i think  uh  if im not now i think i have the potential to be one um  i still consider myself immature as in  im still a student  but  i think i have been given a couple of leadership positions that ive grown a lot from  um  and i think if i was given  if i was put in a different situation i could adapt to it um  would you like an example of a um  so  uh  im copresident of the organization i just mentioned  globemed at mit and  we  uh  basically are in charge  me and my fellow copresident are in charge of about 30 other members um  and this involves a lot of coordination among teams that we have split weve organized our organization into different teams and weve got like campaigns  which is like fundraising team  and weve got communications  is like publicity  finances  and community building  and these are all like split up  at the same time we also have to maintain contact with our partner organization abroad in togo um  so we do a lot with like nonprofit business as well as marketing but also sort of try to appeal to the undergraduate population in terms of fundraising but also awareness so its kind of  pretty multi faceted  i think ive done a lot in terms of building up this organization  it started from scratch essentially  so and  if you wanted examples of leaderships i guess i could the only objective thing would be like what weve accomplished so far  would that be interesting to you um  so  uh  so we started this year essentially  and we were able to secure a lot of sponsorships from different companies such as city sports  dunkin donuts  copy tech  as well as mit sponsorships like the public service center  where they would give us about 3000 to do our project in january in togo and  an mit office donated 62 laptops just this last week so i think  like  weve been definitely doing well like getting our name out there and also  um  achieving what weve set out to do  which is improve healthcare um  well  the project hasnt essentially started but our mission was to provide technology to improve clinical efficiency there so  um  having our first step sort of been made by securing these donations i think is a good step of us showing that we have been succeeding objectively  but  but yeah um  yes  so  i do think ive definitely learned a lot from this experiment  experience  to become more of a team player and i think i  uh  i know what it takes to be a good team player  by seeing what doesnt work  what does work  qualities that i dont think work in other members in interactions that ive had so  an example would be  uh  last year  when globemed first started  i wasnt the copresident  but we had a set of copresidents who were also starting out so  to be fair  it was a totally new concept  new organization  and its  their downfall is they werent that motivated they didnt really seem to care that much about the outcome of our organization and for me and other members that really devoted ourselves to it  it really frustrated us  um  but we had to learn how to be team players in the sense that we couldnt just go out and do everything ourselves and risk stepping on their toes we had to respect their position as our bosses essentially and this definitely was difficult in a lot of ways  i think i learned that you have to know your bounds and know that you cant achieve everything you cant always just brute force your way through things i think that  um  its always the best way  if you ever feel like any conflict is about to arise or if you feel uncomfortable at something  like  immediately schedule a time to meet with that person  just talk it out  completely respectfully  without approaching a bunch of people and asking what they think its just probably better to meet face to face with that person and settle it from the start and then you know if things dont improve after that  there may be other things you can do involving other members  but i think its best  just face to face  yeah  so much of our world is like by email nowadays  so yeah in terms of leadership or  anything oh hm well  my joke would be i wish i was taller  but  hahaha well  i wish i was more  i guess i would change  my  like  time management skills because i think i definitely am not as efficient as id like to be right now  especially as a student um  i think i spend a lot of time on facebook i do a lot of networking  which i think i justify to myself like oh thats good for future endeavors  but i really think i  like  i could be more efficient in terms of like  you know my free time in the summer  like  learn a new programming language like  that could be  thats always something i wanted to do but never end up doing so  so yeah  i would probably change that uh  i think im very like motivated i think because i know how to act as a leader of a group i may not be the most experienced in software development since i just started the major i think i can direct a team of people very diverse from me and working very different from me because i think im a very vocal person i think i communicate well  uh  with people  or attemptfully and i think that can be useful when its a team and  i think software development  like a lot of people think  like  its just one person in a group programming  but i think it really involves a lot of coordination among the team i think i can contribute that way ,4.00819070739,0,good um im junior mit study computer science molecular biology um background biology research year half lab mit basic molecular biology um im also involved couple student group campus one previously involve mit fight world hunger lot charity work local international hunger issue try learn issue right ive devoted time different organization call globemed mit basically partner nonprofit organization abroad work improve hiv healthcare service togo africa people dont know think uh im think potential one um still consider immature im still student think give couple leadership position ive grow lot um think give put different situation could adapt um would like example um uh im copresident organization mention globemed mit uh basically charge fellow copresident charge member um involve lot coordination among team split weve organize organization different team weve get like campaign like fundraise team weve get communication like publicity finance community building like split time also maintain contact partner organization abroad togo um lot like nonprofit business well marketing also sort try appeal undergraduate population term fundraise also awareness kind pretty multi faceted think ive do lot term build organization start scratch essentially want example leadership guess could objective thing would like weve accomplish far would interest um uh start year essentially able secure lot sponsorship different company city sport dunkin donut copy tech well mit sponsorship like public service center would give u project january togo mit office donate laptop last week think like weve definitely well like get name also um achieve weve set improve healthcare um well project hasnt essentially start mission provide technology improve clinical efficiency um first step sort make secure donation think good step u show succeed objectively yeah um yes think ive definitely learn lot experiment experience become team player think uh know take good team player see doesnt work work quality dont think work member interaction ive example would uh last year globemed first start wasnt copresident set copresidents also start fair totally new concept new organization downfall werent motivate didnt really seem care much outcome organization member really devote really frustrated u um learn team player sense couldnt go everything risk step toe respect position boss essentially definitely difficult lot way think learn know bound know cant achieve everything cant always brute force way thing think um always best way ever feel like conflict arise feel uncomfortable something like immediately schedule time meet person talk completely respectfully without approach bunch people ask think probably well meet face face person settle start know thing dont improve may thing involve member think best face face yeah much world like email nowadays yeah term leadership anything oh hm well joke would wish taller hahaha well wish guess would change like time management skill think definitely efficient id like right especially student um think spend lot time facebook lot network think justify like oh thats good future endeavor really think like could efficient term like know free time summer like learn new program language like could thats always something want never end yeah would probably change uh think im like motivated think know act leader group may experience software development since start major think direct team people diverse work different think im vocal person think communicate well uh people attemptfully think useful team think software development like lot people think like one person group program think really involve lot coordination among team think contribute way
pp61,im doing well  thank you laughs o ok umm my name is victoria mcray sp and im an aerospace engineer at mit i am a junior and im in nrtc sp witch is a naval training program that you take during college to commission as an officer  i would say i am a leader in training at this moment umm through rotc i am put in leadership rolls reach semester which help  ahh  build the skills towards becoming a leader  umm  last semester i was a squad leader in rotc  which is where you lead about coughs six to eight people  umm  and you all have to work as a unit to earn  ahh  honor squad at the end of semester  which is dependent on upon  umm  our pt scores which we have competitive pt being physical training  umm we have different physical competitions each week we also have  naval knowledge quizzes  etcetera  in working together umm  and we had  sometimes  the freshman are a little  umm  getting use to it a little slower  in to getting to the swing of things umm  and  we have this one who is having issues with pt  so i helped have extra sessions  to help  umm  do more physical fitness and ended up doing a lot better towards the end my command presence meaning  umm  sometimes im more quite  and its something i think it over and not be as shy about when i talk to others and to feel confident when i know something umm  in order to fix this i often put myself out there and try and coughs not hide in the corner  laughs umm  ive wanted to be a naval fighter pilot for a very  very long time and i have been taking steps to go beyond  umm im going to be taking ground school next semester  and aerospace engineering  umm  and ive gone flying a few times  and i think that through rotc and my own experiences i will be a good candidate for a fighter pilot in the navy ,5.07001699529,1,im well thank laugh ok name victoria mcray sp im aerospace engineer mit junior im nrtc sp witch naval training program take college commission officer would say leader train moment rotc put leadership roll reach semester help ahh build skill towards become leader last semester squad leader rotc lead cough six eight people work unit earn ahh honor squad end semester dependent upon pt score competitive pt physical training different physical competition week also naval knowledge quiz etcetera work together sometimes freshman little get use little slow get swing thing one issue pt help extra session help physical fitness end lot well towards end command presence meaning sometimes im quite something think shy talk others feel confident know something order fix often put try cough hide corner laugh ive want naval fighter pilot long time take step go beyond im go take ground school next semester aerospace engineering ive go fly time think rotc experience good candidate fighter pilot navy
pp62,im good okay so i was born in irvine  california  um where i lived for about ten years and um my parents and i actually moved back to taiwan um at that point so i went to an international school there um it was mostly english speaking  but outside of school i would often speak mandarin also with a couple of friends  um  as well as  you know  just getting by in the outside world yeah  and so  yeah  so when i was after high school  i decided to apply to colleges in the us um just because i was more interested in living here and working here in the future so  yep  applied to a couple of different schools um choosing  ending up choosing mit um i would say that in terms of leadership style i would not consider myself a like a born leader um that said  i do think that i am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things um i tend to be very you know i am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture i think using that while i dont necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that in that respect  i feel like i can i can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner absolutely  yeah  i definitely do consider myself a team player and um an example i can tell you about is i actually work as an emt um so an emergency medical technician here on campus and we have different um ranks within our crew so currently i am a second rider which means that theres theres usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew and so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains and so we didnt know anything about this patient until we got there um but when we did  um mostly the crew chief  the person above me  and i were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem and you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem so that um i think was was the was the root cause of the problem and um i think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line um if i had the option to change one thing about myself um i think that i would definitely choose to make myself more confident um mostly as a speaker  i tend to be i tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when i have to speak in front of large groups of people um and i have worked on that um both as an emt  you know  you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more um and also as leaders of different groups on campus um such as im leader of mit met life as well as the association of taiwanese students so you know in the various uh clubs and groups that i am involved in across campus  ive definitely had to ive definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people okay there are a couple of reasons i think i should get into medical school number one  i have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research i work in a hematology lab here on campus um ive been working here for about a year already um and yeah i really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out um whether or not something works and um so i mentioned before also that i work as an emt so i so beyond having the scientific background  i also have a little bit of clinical background um you know being able to manage patients and to talk to them and i think thats thats you know  a crucial component of being a doctor as well but lastly i have a great deal of passion for the medical field and um i hope that what i what i ultimately learn in medical school will give me i think the you know the opportunity to make a great difference in the medical field ,4.58244744147,0,im good okay bear irvine california um live ten year um parent actually move back taiwan um point go international school um mostly english speaking outside school would often speak mandarin also couple friend um well know get outside world yeah yeah high school decide apply college u um interested living work future yep applied couple different school um choose end choose mit um would say term leadership style would consider like born leader um say think um leadership style come mostly mediating thing um tend know really good step back um look situation um big picture think use dont necessarily know take center stage time know stand know order people around anything like respect feel like usually end manage um different group people well um mediatory kind manner absolutely yeah definitely consider team player um example tell actually work emt um emergency medical technician campus different um rank within crew currently second rider mean there there usually somebody well somebody single crew one case dispatch patient chest pain didnt know anything patient get um um mostly crew chief person discuss know could potentially underlie problem know kind disagree initially um crew chief um talk mention know could cardio problem um think root cause problem um think something know something important um care patient go line um option change one thing um think would definitely choose make confident um mostly speaker tend tend get um pretty nervous yeah speak front large group people um work um emt know really work confidence know patient trust little bit um also leader different group campus um im leader mit meet life well association taiwanese student know various uh club group involve across campus ive definitely ive definitely use opportunity work um know give opportunity speak onstage front large group people okay couple reason think get medical school number one great deal experience um clinical field well research work hematology lab campus um ive work year already um yeah really really enjoy process know go scientific investigation process well know give lot lot joy figure um whether something work um mention also work emt beyond scientific background also little bit clinical background um know able manage patient talk think thats thats know crucial component doctor well lastly great deal passion medical field um hope ultimately learn medical school give think know opportunity make great difference medical field
pp63,pretty good  how was yours yeah its  uh  its been rather pleasant  i thought it was gonna snow today sure uh  so i am an mit junior  originally  i was  uh  a freshman at michigan  and then i transferred to  uh  mit for my sophomore year um  thank you  im studying  uh  computer science and  uh  i guess i didnt really get into computer science until last year  um  or last summer  er  the summer before my sophomore year  and then  um  ever since ive more or less committed to it wholly and every minute to um  i think  in some respects i can be a leader  but i wouldnt say like  in everything i do im a leader  so  um  in certain activities that i take part in  i definitely step up to a leadership position in certain situations  but i dont tend to try to be a leader all the time because i do like to listen to feedback and i like more of a group contribution as opposed to  like  a single person leading all tasks  but  like  i remember doing a team exercise once where  uh  like lowering a hula hoop down with everyones hands  um when you have a group of people in a circle  and we realized that you needed to have someone sort of spearhead the  the operation there otherwise  like  everyones trying to do their own thing  and so there are  its mainly in those situations that ill try to step up  but most of the time i  i dont like to be too controlling oh  definitely um sure  um so  uh  i guess that was one example of a challenge  uh  that we handle as a team  but um  lets seeok  so um  last year i was pledging at my fraternity  and we  one of the activities we do as a pledge  or as pledges  is  um  organize the formal for in the fall  so uh  were just given a budget and general guidelines for what a formal should consist of  and then we  were tasked with setting up everything  so  um  in this situation  like all the 21 pledges uh  we got together and we allocated tasks and  um  obviously when you have a large event like this with so many people where they get together to bring in  to make it happen  you need to  sort of  uh  there are certain people who wont do their jobs  and so  um  part of what we did was  just  have this sort of setup of accountability where  you know  more or less one pledge would check on another group of pledges to make sure that they were getting their task done  and if they needed to help them out  and so  and this way we try to have somewhat decentralized leadership  but still  um  manage to pull off  yeah um  lets see  if i could change one thing i would probably make myself slightly less of a procrastinator  i  um  i have a tendency to  like when i have a lot of free time  uh  to  to work on something  i dont get started  i dont make as much headway initially as i probably could or should  um  and tend  um  in that respect  leave it  its more like  my work is more weighted towards the latter half of the deadline  and so  um  i think just in terms of meeting my own goals like  uh  organizations that i get involved with  projects  it  it would just be more productive to  to be working  uh  full speed the entire time sure um  ok so  a job that id like to have is  uh  software engineering role  at  uh  a tech company or something  uh  and um  i think i am a good fit for the job because i have a pretty strong background in computer programming skill sets for this position  um  ive been taking various computer science classes at mit and engineering classes and learning  uh  the proper was  uh not the proper ways  but  um  good problem solving skills and ways to approach and ways to approach  um  hard problems and  um  thats  i think those are skills that are not difficult  not overly difficult to acquire  but most  many people do not acquire them in  uh  the engineering education oh  good ,4.13378031313,0,pretty good yeah uh rather pleasant think gon na snow today sure uh mit junior originally uh freshman michigan transfer uh mit sophomore year um thank im study uh computer science uh guess didnt really get computer science last year um last summer er summer sophomore year um ever since ive le commit wholly every minute um think respect leader wouldnt say like everything im leader um certain activity take part definitely step leadership position certain situation dont tend try leader time like listen feedback like group contribution oppose like single person lead task like remember team exercise uh like lower hula hoop everyones hand um group people circle realize need someone sort spearhead operation otherwise like everyones try thing mainly situation ill try step time dont like control oh definitely um sure um uh guess one example challenge uh handle team um let seeok um last year pledge fraternity one activity pledge pledge um organize formal fall uh give budget general guideline formal consist task set everything um situation like pledge uh get together allocate task um obviously large event like many people get together bring make happen need sort uh certain people wont job um part sort setup accountability know less one pledge would check another group pledge make sure get task do need help way try somewhat decentralized leadership still um manage pull yeah um let see could change one thing would probably make slightly less procrastinator um tendency like lot free time uh work something dont get start dont make much headway initially probably could um tend um respect leave like work weight towards latter half deadline um think term meet goal like uh organization get involved project would productive work uh full speed entire time sure um ok job id like uh software engineering role uh tech company something uh um think good fit job pretty strong background computer program skill set position um ive take various computer science

acquire uh engineering education oh good
pp64,um  so  my name is andre  uh  i come from finland  ive studied for two years at cambridge university in england  umm where i did all sorts of engineering for the first two years but i chose to specialize in electrical engineering and information technologies um  currently im on an exchange year abroad to mit doing course 6 and at mit im specializing in artificial intelligence  machine learning  score vector machines  and also device physics and some digital electronics um  specifically in the area of device physics and digital electronics im looking at risk processors as well as  um  nanot um  micro and nanoscale  uh  semiconductor devices such as transistors  uhh specifically ballistic transistors  which operate at the smallest possible unit  em  so yeah uhh in the area of ai  i have undertaken  uh  certain competitions  uh  which i have been  uh  lucky to win um  in the first one i had to write a simulator where um  i wrote an ai to control a spacecraft which is   supposed to be able to land and take off from mars and during that  i had to take into account planetary rotation  gravity  atmospheric effects  uh  aerobraking and all those things  so it was a pretty complex ai  to be able to handle all of that um  also i undertook a competition  uh  at cambridge uhh in a team of six  we had to build an autonomous robot which was able to navigate a grid and pick up an object and put it in a  in the appropriate box and there i um was a  a team lead where i managed the team until it did the tasks  and also i wrote the ai for that um  i think i have pretty good leadership qualities  umm mainly because im able to think uhh on a lo longer scale  like what has to get accomplished uhh and be able to delegate tasks to people to achieve intermediate goal which will be kind of modular to the achievement of the uhhh long term goal so for example  in the the  um  robotics project  we had our  our ultimate goal was to build a chassis  build an electronics  build an ai  and have the robot win this competition but uhhh we we didnt go from like scrap metal to that in one go we had to uh  we had to look at um  specifically first i had to write an ai which was uh  straight  the bit of a ai which was able to follow white lines on a black surface  um  and turn on the uh  at the junctions of those lines um  the electronics guys to that end had to  uh  make some circuits which uhh connect the  um  infrared light form sensors to the kind of main cpu  the armcore cpu umm  so there was some circuit elements involved and the  uh  mechanics guys had to pretty much just make a test chassis for us  um  but all that took some organizing because they were busy in the workshops  so they didnt have much time to screw arou  to  uh  play around with  um     you know  other  uh  other things  and the electronics guys had to  um  also schedule the time correctly um  so one of the challenges in the robotics competition  and this specific team  was that  um  we often had to share resources which were limited among other teams and also among the people in the team um  for  one of the resources  if i may say so  which had to be shared in  in our team was myself  because i ha uhh  i was a bit of the project lead so i had to give some advice  and also  umm  sort out some technical points with both the electronics and the mechanics teams  and also i had to write my own ai  so i had to kind of balance between the  uh  two and kind of manage my time  so  what i would try to do was  i would tell them  uh  that we would work out some sort of specific issue  of like sensor connections with the electrical  uh  team  and i would say  okay guys  so youre going to build this now  and  how long is this going to take and they would say  i dont know  its going to take us  uh  a couple hours and then i would have the time to  maybe for half an hour  go down to the workshop where the mechanical team are playing around  and i would talk to them and see  you know  what theyre doing and how how far apart they want the wheels  or something  uh  for the  you know for the touring to be efficient  or  where do you want the balance  because uh  we faced an  an issue if we put too much  um  weight on the back of the robot  the robot might tip over so we try  uhhh we have to  you know  uh  fix that issue but  uh  once i had the two teams working  uh  i was able to go back and quickly  um  write some code so the issue was that i needed to kind of give advice from time to time umm  and i think i did that by delegating tasks pretty well um  i think i would try to become more succinct in how i speak and more engaging to people because often i find that umm i come off sometimes a bit geeky or dorky  and some people might not take to that a as easily and   as a team lead  you have to be both inspiring and charismatic um  i mean  some uhhh  some great examples  i mean  i guess as a cliche  its kind of like steve jobs  where hes  uh  amazingly inspiring  hes very good at talking to people  but hes also  um  like i wouldnt be able to say that hes kind of more adducent to    while at the same time  he is quite  you know  quite the geek being  you know  uh  in charge of apple  and  you know  thinking about how to play with all these unintelligible    toys so  striking a balance like that  where you  kind of  youre kind of able to have the fun with the tech  and also be  uh  kind of serious    um  but not boringserious  um  so i try to strive towards that direction  uh  if i could um  i think that being a project lead in a robotics design team or a  like  an electronic product design team  uhh  would be really great fun  especially if i was also able to participate in the technical side and not only the managerial side umm because being on the managerial side would allow me to  uh  kind of be able to set the  the direction  uh  in some way  which i enjoy doing  and also  manage the kind of  uh  the subteams  and how things will get done but at the same time  being on the technical side  its just fun to play around with all this really cool tech  and build it  especially  its quite rewarding um  so i think i have the technical background for the technical part um  ive  ive done my programming  ive done my ai  ai courses  my electronics courses  so i  so i know that pretty well and i have the experience  um  of working in a team and being a team lead  uhh  to know how to manage a small but efficient team thank you ,4.89416284336,1,um name andre uh come finland ive study two year cambridge university england sort engineering first two year choose specialize electrical engineering information technology um currently im exchange year abroad mit course mit im specialize artificial intelligence machine learn score

play around um know uh thing electronics guy um also schedule time correctly um one challenge robotics competition specific team um often share resource limit among team also among people team um one resource may say share team ha bit project lead give advice also sort technical point electronics mechanic team also write ai kind balance uh two kind manage time would try would tell uh would work sort specific issue like sensor connection electrical uh team would say okay guy youre go build long go take would say dont know go take u uh couple hour would time maybe half hour go workshop mechanical team playing around would talk see know theyre far apart want wheel something uh know tour efficient want balance uh face issue put much um weight back robot robot might tip try uhhh know uh fix issue uh two team work uh able go back quickly um write code issue need kind give advice time time think delegate task pretty well um think would try become succinct speak engage people often

pp65,um so im obviously not from the states as the accent gives away im from a smallish town called carifargus near belfast in northern ireland i just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to cambridge which was something i hadnt really thought was something appropiate for me i kind of just envisaged going to one of the northern irish universities maybe one of the scottish ones um so i applied to cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that i was suitable so ive spent the last two years um there studying engineering and then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the states so i went for that immediately um ive been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering  that should be good fun and was as fenway park i think in my second week here or something a red sox game so immersing myself in the american culture definitely enjoying my time here um yes i think that i have the selfconfidence to be a leader im someone whos happy enough to stand in front of others and put their kind of head on the block as the saying is make a decision and accept that if it does go terrible the consequences will come back and i cant just pass the blame on uh i think this is selfevident in positions ive held so far in my univeristy time in the uk where i was on the student council for my college robinson college in cambridge for both my freshmen and sophomore years um two different positions but both of them elected and competative elections obviously my peers think that im uh suitable leadership material um how does that allude to you from previous response sports is another big part of my life and in that ive had um competency rules with schools rugby and then college rugby and also college ruin um so i feel i have the experience of leader of having been a leader before and i have the confidence to lead others while also realizing at the same time that there will be others in the group that have strengths that i dont have so um im humble enough to realize that and and hopefully get the best out of others by not insisting that the way that ive initially thought to approach the problem is the only solution you can be a leader a very good leader by listening to suggestions that others have and being able to discern which are implementable and which are merely to put on the lets leave that for now pile so yeah i would feel that im a good leader yeah so the obvious examples here would be sporting achievements and stuff but i think and just out of a variety a good antitote for growth um in the uk we still have a monarchy one of the few countries that do and the queens husband rather than being king is the duke of edinburgh im not sure why he doesnt get to be a king but anyway so theres a scheme called duke of edinburghs award which is aimed at 16 17 18 year olds and there are three tiers too bronze silver and gold so ive completed all of them i have the set of the gold and in order to do this a big part of it that people that undertake this scheme that they raise is the expedition element um you go somewhere you havent been before with coordinates certainly maps compass tents troungier and enough food and supplies for like four days um you follow a predetermined route but obviously you have to uh like deal with unexpected realities if theres flooding and suddenly a path is no longer a viable transport option you got to reroute yourself around that if i come too exposed and there are high winds you need to decide for a different sleeping point for that night we did our gold expedition in the summers in the final years of my high school we traveled to which is a very nice area naturally we spent three days four night hiking really glorious weather one big mission when we encountered another group they were lost quite hysterical they thought they will never be found we made a decision we would make a detour from our way to get these other hikers in the nearest area so that they can then contact the other hikers they knew in that area and pretty much get themselves back in to familiar surroundings calm them down make sure they are okay and go on to our planned destination to be honest i did quite enjoyed that experience getting to feel slightly like a hero that was a time when we had to work as a team one of us could not have dealt with all by themselves because they were five hysterical people with all their backpacks and equipments they were tired they werent feeling like carrying any more we had to distribute their load among ourselves and make sure we do not lose them on our way from where we found them to where we ultimately drop them off in the nearest village the whole expedition is a big example of team work keeping each other motivated keep going at the pace of the slowest individual so that no one is left behind  encouraging each other so that the slowest individual is not on the ground  it was massively enjoyable experience that would have been one major team work experience i think umm the one thing that really seems to set me aside between me and a lot of friends and my brothers that i could probably benefit from caring a little more about my outward appearance not that i think i dress very scruffly or anything but i dont really mind leaving the house in the morning with my hair soaking shower and wearing jeans and tshirt two out of three of my brothers worry about straighten hair which i wouldnt agree at all but if i cared little more just making sure my hair is not messy when i leave the house that would probably be small benefit given that even though there is a saying dont judge by covers people inevitably make decisions as soon as they see you and they cant perhaps if i was a bit more self conscious about my appearance that would be something of a benefit i think this is the kind of job in which job satisfaction can be the greatest benefit if it is something that is genuinely interesting to you and as i said before i have such a deep rooted interest in space exploration just really pushing the limits of what we can achieve i feel that this kind of job is what i will just get up in the mornings really thrilled get into work and do my parts towards contributing towards it umm i realize its also the kind of job where projects are really so vast ranging there is gonna be inevitable variety and also this would scare me i would be really drawn i get to challenge myself in various different ways novel situations that i perhaps havent encountered before with the opportunity to work with other professionals who are equally umm well established within the field that you are really getting to work with the best and that can only help improve me as a professional and as a business person and its um yeah other things such as inevitable prestige and umm the financial benefit just the job satisfaction  i can easily see this something that will interest keep me coming back for work for the length of my career that would be the key reason um i think i would just be able to enjoy the work and therefore put my best and get the best out of my and ultimately give the company the best chance to success thanks for letting me come out umm it turned out okay i think it was a group of case female 17 to 18 years age range we opened nearby village public and get to a public phone our school was quite strict didnt allow us to bring mobile phone which was probably a good thing ,4.19674891222,0,um im obviously state accent give away im smallish town call carifargus near belfast northern ireland go local primary school equivalent elementary school um people side pond uh like local high school uh encourage within year consider apply cambridge something hadnt really think something appropiate kind envisage go one northern irish university maybe one scottish one um apply cambridge luckily seem think suitable ive spend last two year um study engineering opportunity come spend junior year state go immediately um ive move specialism aerospace engineering good fun fenway park think second week something red sox game immerse american culture definitely enjoying time um yes think selfconfidence leader im someone who happy enough stand front others put kind head block say make decision accept go terrible consequence come back cant pas blame uh think selfevident position ive hold far univeristy time uk student council college robinson college cambridge freshman sophomore year um two different position elect competative election obviously peer think im uh suitable leadership material um allude previous response sport another big part life ive um competency rule school rugby college rugby also college ruin um feel experience leader leader confidence lead others also realize time others group strengths dont um im humble enough realize hopefully get best others insist way ive initially think approach problem solution leader good leader listen suggestion others able discern implementable merely put let leave pile yeah would feel im good leader yeah obvious example would sport achievement stuff think variety good antitote growth um uk still monarchy one country queen husband rather king duke edinburgh im sure doesnt get king anyway there scheme call duke edinburghs award aim year old three tier bronze silver gold ive complete set gold order big part people undertake scheme raise expedition element um go somewhere havent coordinate certainly map compass tent troungier enough food supply like four day um follow predetermine route obviously uh like deal unexpected reality theres flood suddenly path longer viable transport option get reroute around come expose high wind need decide different sleep point night gold expedition summer final year high school travel nice area naturally spend three day four night hike really glorious weather one big mission encounter another group lose quite hysterical thought never find make decision would make detour way get hiker nearest area contact hiker know area pretty much get back familiar surroundings calm make sure okay go planned destination honest quite enjoyed experience get feel slightly like hero time work team one u could deal five hysterical people backpack equipment tire werent feeling like carry distribute load among make sure lose way find ultimately drop near village whole expedition big example team work keep motivated keep go pace slow individual one leave behind encouraging slow individual ground massively enjoyable experience would one major team work experience think one thing really seem set aside lot friend brother could probably benefit care little outward appearance think dress scruffly anything dont really mind leave house morning hair soak shower wear jean tshirt two three brother worry straighten hair wouldnt agree cared little make sure hair messy leave house would probably small benefit give even though say dont judge cover people inevitably make decision soon see cant perhaps bite self conscious appearance would something benefit think kind job job satisfaction great benefit something genuinely interesting say deep root interest space exploration really push limit achieve feel kind job get morning really thrill get work part towards contribute towards realize also kind job project really vast range gon na inevitable variety also would scare would really draw get challenge various different way novel situation perhaps havent encountered opportunity work professional equally well establish within field really get work best help improve professional business person um yeah thing inevitable prestige financial benefit job satisfaction easily see something interest keep come back work length career would key reason um think would able enjoy work therefore put best get best ultimately give company best chance success thanks let come turn okay think group case female year age range open nearby village public get public phone school quite strict didnt allow u bring mobile phone probably good thing
pp66,im a student here at mit  im in my third year as a junior  um  and im studying chemical biological engineering with a minor in economics and so  as part of that ive uh taken coursework in transport processes  thermodynamics  chemical biological processes  and things like that and also some macro  micro  public policy classes with the econ and then im also doing research in chemical engineering laboratory here for a year and a half studying yeast  um  and different ways of doing transcription factors and how they relate then to promoter architecture and the dynamics that are behind that so  lot of bio chemical engineering complications and i also did some research this past summer in a systems biology lab in madrid  spain  um  so a little more biology related  so  those are most of my technical background yeah  so um  i definitely think im a leader and thats actually something thats come to define a lot of my time here at mit is leadership um  and so i think im a leader both because of the actions ive taken and also the mindset i have and as actions  i guess both of those things are important so to give an example  um  im currently in a position of leadership in a club on campus  our habitat for humanity club  um  where i serve as the president of the club and i think i started off as a freshman  um  just participating  i really like community service so i volunteered with them a bit to go help build houses in the bostoncambridge area  um  and then i was fairly proactive which led me to start organizing those builds that i was going on  i figured i was benefiting from them  so i wanted to be able to give back and organize them so i ran for the exec of habitat for humanity here and started helping organize them  and then from there i went on to wanting to do more  and so now im president and run the exec and get to do everything that the club does  and so  um  i think that kind of drive and that desire to move up and give back and contribute and also make things happen definitely is characteristic of a leader um  and obviously  the position im currently in is one that demands leadership so i think thats just one illustrative example of why im a leader yeah  um  so i definitely think im a team player  um  and i think mit especially is really conducive to teamwork um  but ill look at a example of team work than relates actually to  um  im also involved in leadership within my fraternity and so  as a part of that  um  we have a five person exec that uh i wasnt on to begin with  but uh  ive now loosened up and wanted to take on more leadership  help out  and so im currently on and so  as a part of that five person exec  um  weve had to do a lot of teamwork theres five of us  theres uh  my fraternity has seventy people um  so its very large and it requires a lot of working together in order to  um  accomplish really any task and so i think  um  one illustrative example is we wanted to put on a philanthropy event that i was spearheading in my position i was doing brotherhood development activities  like a philanthropy even and so  we havent really had much precedent  we havent had an event in a couple of years  um  and so i had come up with a summer with an event based off some stuff for other friends and other schools who ive talked to um  and so i had the idea for the event and then i had to work with these other four members to kind of lead the rest of our brotherhood in putting on the event  organizing it  um  and there was a lot challenges because it wasnt  there was no precedent  we hadnt done things like this in the past  um  so we had to work to like motivate people within ourselves to go out and get people to register and participate and things like that um  and theres also of course the challenge of then finding others um  give us five dollars to participate in our event  why its of any value  why it matters and so that duality was really a challenge  as well as of course working amongst ourselves  and so we met those by really laying out very concrete goals  um  and like  doing a lot of brainstorming among the five of us  breaking up  um  to focus on different elements of the problems we would face um  and the event ended up being really tremendously successful and then we had a lot of people participate we met those goals of participation and money raised um  and then were able to have the event again this year and really set a precedent that hadnt existed before  so  it was very successful um  so i think currently  um  what my greatest weakness  and one which im working on  is my ability  i talked a lot just now about leadership positions and so they definitely impact me a lot right now my ability to successfully delegate  um and the word  im not necessarily looking for the word micromanage  but just truly delegate responsibility  work with another person  and let them be very responsible and communicate with them i think i struggle there and thats definitely a weakness in my leadership as well as just my general activities because i struggle just to let that person kind of go and foster their own ideas and get their own job done im very quick to step in and assist maybe step on their toes even or at least provide feedback sometimes it is warranted and sometimes i think it isnt  and so to be more cognizant of that and to uh be better adept to deal with that i think would be very helpful and so  id love to see that change it is something im working towards and im working with people whose leadership i admire  um  who i think do a better job of that then me and try and model myself after them  but currently i do think its a weakness that id like to improve okay yes so  for this particular job  um  i think my greatest assets are the combination of skills and experiences that i bring to the table um and i think that itd be very valuable for the position so i have a very strong technical background  im in my third year at mit studying chemical biological engineering which requires a wide array of very challenging coursework um  and ive done research in the field as well  so all of those skills combine to give me a strong technical set of both problem solving and engineering based skills and then i also have done a lot of work outside of the classroom  both in projects that are academic related and totally not  community services related and things of that nature  um truly develop communication skills  organization skills  um  and the ability to really take a project and get it done and so i think for this position i will have the technical background to fully understand and wrap my mind around and make goals that i want to accomplish just solve a problem and then these other skills will ensure that not only can i identify a problem  but if i identify a problem i will get it done and i know how to facilitate whatever resources that are available to me to ensure that whatever job gets done well  so i think that will make me a very strong candidate ,5.61150090519,1,im student mit im third year junior um im study chemical biological engineering minor economics part ive uh take coursework transport process thermodynamics chemical biological process thing like also macro micro public policy class econ im also research chemical engineering laboratory year half study yeast um different way transcription factor relate promoter architecture dynamic behind lot bio chemical engineering complication also research past summer system biology lab madrid spain um little biology relate technical background yeah um definitely think im leader thats actually something thats come define lot time mit leadership um think im leader action ive take also mindset action guess thing important give example um im currently position leadership club campus habitat humanity club um serve president club think start freshman um participate really like community service volunteer bit go help build house bostoncambridge area um fairly proactive lead start organize build go figure benefit want able give back organize run exec habitat humanity start help organize go want im president run exec get everything club um think kind drive desire move give back contribute also make thing happen definitely characteristic leader um obviously position im currently one demand leadership think thats one illustrative example im leader yeah um definitely think im team player um think mit especially really conducive teamwork um ill look example team work relate actually um im also involved leadership within fraternity part um five person exec uh wasnt begin uh ive loosen wanted take leadership help im currently part five person exec um weve lot teamwork there five u there uh fraternity seventy people um large require lot work together order um accomplish really task think um one illustrative example want put philanthropy event spearhead position brotherhood development activity like philanthropy even havent really much precedent havent event couple year um come summer event base stuff friend school ive talk um idea event work four member kind lead rest brotherhood put event organize um lot challenge wasnt precedent hadnt do thing like past um work like motivate people within go get people register participate thing like um there also course challenge find others um give u five dollar participate event value matter duality really challenge well course work amongst meet really lay concrete goal um like lot brainstorm among five u break um focus different element problem would face um event end really tremendously successful lot people participate meet goal participation money raise um able event year really set precedent hadnt exist successful um think currently um great weakness one im work ability talk lot leadership position definitely impact lot right ability successfully delegate um word im necessarily look word micromanage truly delegate responsibility work another person let responsible communicate think struggle thats definitely weakness leadership well general activity struggle let person kind go foster idea get job do im quick step assist maybe step toe even least provide feedback sometimes warrant sometimes think isnt cognizant uh well adept deal think would helpful id love see change something im working towards im work people whose leadership admire um think good job try model currently think weakness id like improve okay yes particular job um think great asset combination skill experience bring table um think itd valuable position strong technical background im third year mit study chemical biological engineering require wide array challenge coursework um ive do research field well skills combine give strong technical set problem solve engineering base skill also do lot work outside classroom project academic relate totally community service related thing nature um truly develop communication skill organization skill um ability really take project get do think position technical background fully understand wrap mind around make goal want accomplish solve problem skills ensure identify problem identify problem get do know facilitate whatever resource available ensure whatever job get do well think make strong candidate
pp67,alright um so  for starters  i am a senior taking an extra semester so you know  halfway through junior year in that sense im a chemical engineer  im a rower  light weight rower  not a heavy weight i have the extra  an extra bonus of having to deal with a weight cap  that sort of thing diving in the middle of the year can be fun sometimes im in a fraternity  um it actually recently started up so i was a founding father of the fraternity  its sigma alpha epselon and ive also done very rougly coordinated engineering leadership program so id say those are my main commitments i had done other things earlier one  i went to baker and i was very involved in the executive committee there and im also an active member in creating the dining plan that currently exists at mit its got some pros and cons  but it is a good experience so sort of like go door to door and talk to people and really see  let them know whats coming up that sort of thing in general id say im a pretty active person on campus  pretty well known  um and i do a lot of things to keep myself in shape but also academically stimulated with chemical engineering and whatnot  very much so um i guess to start out  being part of the sport sort of creates a natural affinity towards teamwork especially with rowing youre depending on other people to be able to accomplish a common goal  theres eight guys in a boat and then theres the person that steers it and if one person gives up you guys arent going to win so that is very much like teamwork  it also coincides with leadership rowig doesnt necessarily cultivate leadership  it sort of cultivates like personal dedication and willingness to contribute to the whole but i feel like i get my leadership experiences from my fraternity especially since it started out  i was one of eight people  there was five that was the founding five  that was part of the first pledge class and when things are starting up everyone needs to take a leadership role and if anyone like cuts any slack its very likely that the whole ship is going to sink so right from the get go i was given tons of responsibility and i went with it i did as much as i could in each of the positions and eventually i came up to the role of  you know  the president um and in that role ive gotten a lot of praise from the alumni groups and from my students  but generally i feel like im a pretty good  i like to work with people  um i can relate to them  and generally pretty sociable  so yeah alright  let me come up with a good example here alright  gordon has a new leadership program very much about being a team player theres different opportunities that that program provides  every single week its divided up so that each student gets an opportunity to be a leader or be a part of the team one of the modules for instance  there was  it was a negotiation module so every single table was given a set of legos and there was the goal of the project was to create satellites which requires a certain number of colored legos from each table  and every table was given different combinations so i was not the team leader in that case  but the team leaders goal was to make sure that we had good negotiations going with all of the tables adjacent to us  and coordinating everything and at times it got a little bit frustrating because there were time limits  and people were running all over the place and one of my roles was to be one of the negotiators  so as the team player my role was to simply talk to one table  get as best of a result as possible to get the parts that we need to make the satellite but not to be directing people and nothing of the sort um my natural instinct is to direct people so what i had to do instead to make sure that i was used effectively as a team leader  you know  just give the team leader suggestions  that sort of things  but also do my duty  negotiate  we consulted for a while said  ok cameron  we need to get three white legos for four brown legos etc etc so i managed to get my end of the deal done um also contribute to the team leader but also give him advice  and that sort of thing its kind of a lower key example  just because those modules  the time schedule is an hour but they put you in a high pressure situation  but i felt like i did a good job there because i didnt go all up in arms and tell the team leader that he was not doing a good job  that sort of thing so i did my best to give him the suggestions to steer him in the right direction and ultimately it got us to the end goal yeah i go back and forth with this when i was younger in middle school  uh i was a lot more modest  i was just generally a quieter person you know  everyone goes through different phases  through elementary  middle  high school  college  that sort of thing um and ultimately i turned into someone taht was a lot more sociable  outgoing  that sort of thing but at times i feel that i can come off as  i hate saying this but i  other people dont say it but sometimes i feel like i may say something and it might be cocky or something of the sort so one thing im really trying to balance is to make sure that i have confidence but its not overbearing so i guess  what id wanna do right now  like if i could change something  is really try and bring back the modesty because i really respect people that are modest but still able to get a lot of work done um and  i mean  its not something that i cant change  its just something thats really not jibing with my personality right now so  im really  you know  trying to tow the line but if i could make that switch  id at least like to see what kind of a person id like to be right now i guess  i guess ill leave that answer for now yeah yeah well  the job is  its a pretty  lots of people look are sort of looking at it at mit but its consulting you work with people  you work with teams  and every single team has a project with a defined deadline  scope  budget  that sort of thing which is the stuff ive learned from the gordon leadership engineering program um  so that you know  exactly that  working in a team  trying to accomplish a goal in a certain time  blah  blah  blah im a very big fan of that  ever since i joined the program im like wow  this is business  i like business and the reason why i prefer consulting right now rather than going into energy or going into connectors that sort of thing  is just because of the breadth i like  im a person that likes to keep my doors open  and consulting is one of those really good segways in my opinion from undergraduate into the industry im not particularly interested in grad school at the moment just because theres no one thing that like  i wanna like  i dont wanna narrow my scope quite yet so i feel like consulting will give me an environment where theres still a young vibe with a lot of newer people and also expose me to older people and really  uh  ill be able to test my skills that ive cultivated while ive been here in the job industry yeah ,4.43528871219,0,alright um starter senior take extra semester know halfway junior year sense im chemical engineer im rower light weight rower heavy weight extra extra bonus deal weight cap sort thing dive middle year fun sometimes im fraternity um actually recently start found father fraternity sigma alpha epselon ive also do rougly coordinate engineering leadership program id say main commitment do thing earlier one go baker involve executive committee im also active member create din plan currently exist mit get pros con good experience sort like go door door talk people really see let know whats come sort thing general id say im pretty active person campus pretty well know um lot thing keep shape also academically stimulated chemical engineering whatnot much um guess start part sport sort create natural affinity towards teamwork especially rowing youre depend people able accomplish common goal there eight guy boat theres person steer one person give guys arent go win much like teamwork also coincide leadership rowig doesnt necessarily cultivate leadership sort cultivates like personal dedication willingness contribute whole feel like get leadership experience fraternity especially since start one eight people five found five part first pledge class thing start everyone need take leadership role anyone like cut slack likely whole ship go sink right get go give ton responsibility go much could position eventually come role know president um role ive gotten lot praise alumnus group student generally feel like im pretty good like work people um relate generally pretty sociable yeah alright let come good example alright gordon new leadership program much team player theres different opportunity program provide every single week divide student get opportunity leader part team one modules instance negotiation module every single table give set legos goal project create satellite require certain number color legos table every table give different combination team leader case team leader goal make sure good negotiation go table adjacent u coordinate everything time get little bit frustrating time limit people run place one roles one negotiator team player role simply talk one table get best result possible get part need make satellite directing people nothing sort um natural instinct direct people instead make sure use effectively team leader know give team leader suggestion sort thing also duty negotiate consult say ok cameron need get three white lego four brown lego etc etc manage get end deal do um also contribute team leader also give advice sort thing kind lower key example module time schedule hour put high pressure situation felt like good job didnt go arm tell team leader good job sort thing best give suggestion steer right direction ultimately get u end goal yeah go back forth young middle school uh lot modest generally quieter person know everyone go different phase elementary middle high school college sort thing um ultimately turn someone taht lot sociable outgo sort thing time feel come hate say people dont say sometimes feel like may say something might cocky something sort one thing im really try balance make sure confidence overbear guess id wan na right like could change something really try bring back modesty really respect people modest still able get lot work do um mean something cant change something thats really jib personality right im really know try tow line could make switch id least like see kind person id like right guess guess ill leave answer yeah yeah well job pretty lots people look sort look mit consult work people work teams every single team project define deadline scope budget sort thing stuff ive learn gordon leadership engineering program um know exactly work team try accomplish goal certain time blah blah blah im big fan ever since join program im like wow business like business reason prefer consult right rather go energy go connector sort thing breadth like im person like keep door open consult one really good segway opinion undergraduate industry im particularly interested grad school moment theres one thing like wan na like dont wan na narrow scope quite yet feel like consult give environment there still young vibe lot new people also expose old people really uh ill able test skill ive cultivate ive job industry yeah
pp69, uhh  so im uhh  i was born in dc  moved to nigeria when i was seven  umm  came back to america for my junior and senior year of highschool and applied to mit  i always wanted to be a mechanical engineer  so it was sort of a straightforward choice for me  it was always my first choice school  and umm  i was excited to come here and to start learning things  it just  in the past  it had just been sort of hearing about things but not doing anything or learning about it  which was exciting  so im studying mechanical engineering here now  and umm  im concentrating in computer science and electro engineering  which has been a new found interest  i guess  its uhh  im a junior now  so yeah  i do think im a leader in some regards  i mean  its important to not always  and sometimes you dont want to be a leader  um  its important to know how to follow as well  but i think  umm  i am  like  in most situations  a leader  for example  i was  uh  sort of like  the leader for my 212 intro to robotics group  where we build a robot  amongst the four of us  four to five  uhh  my group happened to be four  we built a robot  i sort of lead the group  organizing meetings  uhh  delegating tasks  making sure that everyone was doing  uhh  what they were meant to  and just getting everyone on the same page  so just instances like that  i think  have shaped me into being a leader  uhh  so yeah  like i said  its also important to know how to  you know  let someone else take the lead  and so  my other project class this semester im taking  to double in unintelligible  and its a group of eight people  so theres even more  sort of  heads to balance  and so  uhh  just sort of working with everyone  making sure that  you know  everyone sort of has a say in whats going on  theres a particular instance where its at the beginning of the project  were meant to design a yoyo  and we couldnt really decide on a design  cause everyone wanted to do their own sort of thing  and  umm  my role in that particular situation was to  getting everyone to recognize the manufacturing aspect and not only the design aspect  so we ended up choosing something that was easy to manufacture as well as had a good design  change one thing about myself  uhh  id say  like  toi wish i had a sort of  better background of academics  uhh  i didnt go to  like  the best high school  i didnt  uhh  like  have the best teachers or things like that  and coming to a place like this and sort of seeing a lot of people who are  i mean  obviously kind of naturally talented  but who have also had good theyve had opportunities to  uhh  show their talent and get better and smarter  umm  i wish i couldve had that opportunity  i think id be  uhh  even more  i could do more things than i am doing today  so  yeah  mmmhmm  because  uhh  you should hire me for a few reasons  one  is because my leadership  uhh  abilities  which ive talked a little bit about  umm  a little earlier  but  also  just my willingness to learn  umm  i think  more than the average person  im excited to learn new things  umm  and sort of put those things in practice  and  just as an example  i didnt know anything about computer science before coming to mit  but  just uhh  taking just the introductory class  learning about that  i got really interested in that  and so  id say that when i dont know a lot of things  or when my experience isnt the best  im always willing to learn a lot  and lastly  im a really hard worker  and so  im able to put in the hours and the time and the energy that it takes to  sort of  get a task done  its uhh  yeah  i think id make a good intern  thank you ,4.70754806622,0,im bear dc move nigeria seven come back america junior senior year highschool apply mit always want mechanical engineer sort straightforward choice always first choice school excite come start learn thing past sort hearing thing anything learn excite im study mechanical engineering im concentrate computer science electro engineering new find interest guess im junior yeah think im leader regard mean important always sometimes dont want leader um important know follow well think like situation leader example uh sort like leader intro robotics group build robot amongst four u four five group happen four built robot sort lead group organize meeting delegate task make sure everyone mean get everyone page instance like think shaped leader yeah like say also important know know let someone else take lead project class semester im take double unintelligible group eight people there even sort head balance sort work everyone make sure know everyone sort say whats go there particular instance beginning project mean design yoyo couldnt really decide design cause everyone want sort thing role particular situation get everyone recognize manufacturing aspect design aspect end choose something easy manufacture well good design change one thing id say like toi wish sort well background academic didnt go like best high school didnt like best teacher thing like come place like sort see lot people mean obviously kind naturally talented also good theyve opportunity show talent get good smarter wish couldve opportunity think id even could thing today yeah mmmhmm hire reason one leadership abilities ive talk little bit little earlier also willingness learn think average person im excite learn new thing sort put thing practice example didnt know anything computer science come mit take introductory class learning get really interested id say dont know lot thing experience isnt best im always willing learn lot lastly im really hard worker im able put hour time energy take sort get task do yeah think id make good intern thank
pp7,ok im a junior at mit majoring in electrical engineering computer science as well as mathematics um and i have a couple of previous internships under my belt as you can see on my resume  so i feel like i come prepared with a lot of experience both from school and outside uh yes  i would say that i am a leader um in particular ive been involved in many student groups on campus such as educational studies program  mystery hunt and several other groups that i have leaderships positions in but even when i dont have a formal leadership role as i do in those groups  i feel like i still tend to take charge in situations  whether its a group project for the class where  you know were supposed to be working collaboratively but ill be sending emails to make sure were moving forward and making progress or something a bit more structured actually supposed to have a have a leader like i mentioned student groups  yeah so yes  heh  i would call myself a team player and to go back to sort of one of the examples i was just talking about with uh the educational studies program with a fairly large student group we have a couple hundred different mit students teach with us but a core team of about 30 to 40 admins who come to meetings every week and help out and unfortunately being college students theres a lot of personal conflict between members and i have had to step in several times with sort of individual people first notice that theres a problem  um talk to the people in question individually to figure out more about whats going on and then intervene and sort of set aside rules and sort of help them interact well professionally and keep their problems outside the group um i dont really want to get into details because some of these can be personal but i have had to do this its a difficult question id probably say my age i feel like there are a lot of experiences ive missed out on  sort of looking backing at you know  high school  say now that im in college or looking back at a first internship once ive done a second um  there are a lot of ways i think i couldve learned more or matured more as a person had i got into situations with a different mindset so um i guess what im trying to say is if i knowing what i know now will able to go uh redo some of the things of the past year at least which isnt physically possible ok  well as i mentioned before i have a lot of experience  i leadership  im a team player but uh beyond that i think im just very well qualified and passionate about your company and would be excited to join the team and work with you guys to further your goals ,5.38627905146,1,ok im junior mit major electrical engineering computer science well mathematics um couple previous internship belt see resume feel like come prepared lot experience school outside uh yes would say leader um particular ive involve many student group campus educational study program mystery hunt several group leaderships position even dont formal leadership role group feel like still tend take charge situation whether group project class know suppose work collaboratively ill send email make sure move forward make progress something bit structured actually suppose leader like mention student group yeah yes heh would call team player go back sort one examples talk uh educational study program fairly large student group couple hundred different mit student teach u core team admins come meeting every week help unfortunately college student theres lot personal conflict member step several time sort individual people first notice there problem um talk people question individually figure whats go intervene sort set aside rule sort help interact well professionally keep problem outside group um dont really want get detail personal difficult question id probably say age feel like lot experience ive miss sort look backing know high school say im college look back first internship ive do second um lot way think couldve learn mature person get situation different mindset um guess im try say know know able go uh redo thing past year least isnt physically possible ok well mention lot experience leadership im team player uh beyond think im well qualified passionate company would excite join team work guy goal
pp70, im good uh so i am a biology major at the it um  burton of biology im also getting a minor in chemistry im currently pursuing research on marine microbiology   specifically carlson bounds at the thompson lab um  previously i had worked on arsenic metabolizing simbions in the sponge in israel  and i hope to continue working on marinemicrobes  umm  i would say i was a leader not so much  uhm   in maybe project teams but definitely in terms of uhm my research view  i would like to be on the cutting edge of uhm new research and to  uhm  microbes encyclobes vents part of the ocean  so i would say that im really looking forward to researching  but really havent been exposed so much  uhh yeah i would def consider myself a team  um  player uh  so  when  i am part of the team hpv group now at it so we raise awareness about the hepititus b virus so we rec had a lot of difficulties with quest  uhm  industries  so theyre the ones that provide us with phlebotomists and in order to conduct the screening  hepatitis b screenings that we have so uhm there is a pretty large conflict about like how we should reach out to them to get them to get them to interact with us and whether or not we should   uhm  maybe reach out to other providers and i definitely tried to make sure that we were keeping up with our contacts at quest as well as like researching like new avenues  reaching out to giliad  which is another industry  uhm   core that could  uhm   also  that works actually with mit in particular um so together we delegated work  and so one person had to do this  um  reach out to them and one person had to do that and i was def a big part of taking in whatever  everything that we had to do and like trying to make sure everyone had something in order to not let this really important part of our work would be lost  uh  i would def say it would be  my self confidence issues or rather  my ability to speak up and be more  uhm   assertive about my point of view ive definitely  a lot of times  kept quiet or just like put my views on the back burner  especially i think when i was a fresh coming to a new country it was very difficult to integrate and also like to navigate my way in  so i think im still trying to cope with that  i def think i deserve to get into grad school because its the only thing i want to do  research for me is extremely exciting  and there is a lot i feel like its the most meaningful way that i can contribute to   uh  the scientific world and especially in my field uuh i def am dedicated to research its what i want to do for the rest of my life so i hope that i get this opportunity ,4.81904388374,1,im good uh biology major um burton biology im also get minor chemistry im currently pursue research marine microbiology specifically carlson bound thompson lab um previously work arsenic metabolizing simbions sponge israel hope continue work marinemicrobes would say leader much maybe project team definitely term research view would like cut edge new research microbe encyclobes vent part ocean would say im really look forward research really havent expose much yeah would def consider team um player uh part team hpv group raise awareness hepititus b virus rec lot difficulty quest industry theyre one provide u phlebotomists order conduct screen hepatitis b screening pretty large conflict like reach get get interact u whether maybe reach provider definitely try make sure keep contact quest well like research like new avenue reach giliad another industry core could also work actually mit particular um together delegate work one person um reach one person def big part take whatever everything like try make sure everyone something order let really important part work would lose uh would def say would self confidence issue rather ability speak assertive point view ive definitely lot time keep quiet like put view back burner especially think fresh come new country difficult integrate also like navigate way think im still try cope def think deserve get grad school thing want research extremely exciting lot feel like meaningful way contribute uh scientific world especially field uuh def dedicate research want rest life hope get opportunity
pp71,im good  how are you so im studying mechanical engineering at mit  and i am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering and ive chosen to concentrate on building technology and on top of that  um im double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration and id say two years ago  two summers ago sorry  i interned at square one armoring services  which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government and i interned with them for two summers  and this was before i really chose the building technology route i didnt really like the super mechy side of it this past summer i interned in barcelona  um  with a company called ilon  theyre a very large engineering consulting firm and i worked in their architecture department and i really enjoyed the experience so  im going that direction i believe i am a leader um  i normally  i wouldnt necessarily run for positions  but when it comes down to someone filling the spot  i will step up  um  and make sure that things get done i feel that i might be more of aof an encourager  so to speaki dont really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but i try  sort of to like  to lead people in the direction that i want to go to and to integrate their input with mine um  so i uh  had a coach here this past year to plan the campus preview weekend dinner  um at my sorority its a weekend where mit prefreshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from mit and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus and um  so my coach and i had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it  but i feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event um  a lot of the girls that came to the dinner  um  who are now freshmen  still say  oh i remember you from unintelligible it was a really good feeling to get through that um  id probably change trying to be a perfectionist um  i like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things um  i think thats something  to sort of  a strange thing to work on  to let things be sometimes  heh i think im qualified for this position academically  and ive taken a lot of courses that apply to building technology and my intern experience as well im really interested in the subject matter  and my parents are architects  so ive sort of had this my whole life and ive always kind of denied my interest in architecture because everyone always pushed me towards it  but now i do realize that this is something i truly enjoy and sort of mixing it in with my other more technical interests  um  i feel bring me further in the field ,5.33449110356,1,im good im study mechanical engineering mit take flexible course let concentrate subject mechanical engineering ive chosen concentrate building technology top um im double minoring energy architecture supplement concentration id say two year ago two summer ago sorry intern square one armoring service company manufacture armored vehicle government intern two summer really choose build technology route didnt really like super mechy side past summer intern barcelona um company call ilon theyre large engineering consulting firm work architecture department really enjoyed experience im go direction believe leader um normally wouldnt necessarily run position come someone fill spot step um make sure thing get do feel might aof encourager speaki dont really like slide idea table make everyone follow try sort like lead people direction want go integrate input mine um uh coach past year plan campus preview weekend dinner um sorority weekend mit prefreshmen come campus see like feel mit big recruiting event lot different group around campus um coach different idea time want go feel communication defiantly important factor sort get difficulty work together team wound really successful event um lot girl come dinner um freshman still say oh remember unintelligible really good feeling get um id probably change try perfectionist um like thing right sometimes time efficient energy efficient way get thing um think thats something sort strange thing work let thing sometimes heh think im qualify position academically ive take lot course apply build technology intern experience well im really interested subject matter parent architects ive sort whole life ive always kind denied interest architecture everyone always push towards realize something truly enjoy sort mix technical interest um feel bring field
pp72, good  how are you  um  ok  so im a third year linguistics student  umm  im  uhh  working on some linguistics research right now and im interested in going into linguistics research after undergrad  um  yea i think im uhh leader  i think ive fulfilled leadership positions in the past and umm i think ive excelled in that role umm  ive led different group projects in my classes and ive also been umm a resident associate advisor in my dorm umm  and ive led activities there where we had to organize events for freshmen once a month uhh to get them interested in different aspects of the curriculum and also umm just general helping them out for things  so  ok  umm  so yea i think i work well as a team member  umm  for a big group project we had in one of my linguistics classes  umm  we had to look at aspects of a language and so we were broken into groups of four  umm  and we were each split to look into different aspect of the language so two people looked at the phonology  or the sounds of the system  and my partner and i looked at the grammar of the language  and so one of the two people assigned to the phonology group wasnt really following through with his part of the work  umm  he  i guess he was busy with other classes but his partner was really stressed out about it so she came and talked to my partner and i and asked what she should do about it  cause he wasnt helping out  and so  the three of us sort of talked about it  and then we emailed him asked if he could come meet with all of us the four of us were able to talk about it and work out an agreement where he did some of thesome extra work in putting the two parts together  the phonology and the syntax  to make up for the fact that he hadnt done as much for the original research  so  that ended up working out well  so  um  i think it wouldprobably be my shyness because that tends to hold me back  um  but i think ive been working to change that  um  ive been trying to practice things umm like presentations that make me nervous or that i have problems with because im shy  ive also been trying to get out and meet more people ive been doing more extracurriculars and  umm  i volunteered to teach a class to middle schoolers and high schoolers  so  that sort of helped in a low stress environment practising presenting  um  i think i would be a really good addition to a linguistics research team  because im really really passionate about linguistics and its something i really enjoy spending lots of time working on  um  and i enjoy working on a team and i work well with other people  and ive had research positions in the past and i think i would umm be a good addition to a team ,5.67088148272,1,good um ok im third year linguistics student im work linguistics research right im interested go linguistics research undergrad um yea think im leader think ive fulfilled leadership position past think ive excel role ive lead different group project class ive also resident associate advisor dorm ive lead activity organize event freshman month get interested different aspect curriculum also general help thing ok yea think work well team member big group project one linguistics class look aspect language break group four split look different aspect language two people look phonology sound system partner look grammar language one two people assign phonology group wasnt really follow part work guess busy class partner really stress come talked partner ask cause wasnt help three u sort talk email ask could come meet u four u able talk work agreement thesome extra work put two part together phonology syntax make fact hadnt do much original research end work well um think wouldprobably shyness tends hold back um think ive work change um ive try practice thing like presentation make nervous problem im shy ive also try get meet people ive extracurriculars volunteer teach class middle schoolers high schoolers sort help low stress environment practise present um think would really good addition linguistics research team im really really passionate linguistics something really enjoy spend lot time work um enjoy work team work well people ive research position past think would good addition team
pp73, im good  how are you  im a freshman at mit here  so im studying courses 6 and 18 which is computer science and math  umm in high school i did a lot of community work service  i was the president of our united way board which is a not for profit  i did a lot of our school clubs  math teams classic goal i was captain of a lot of those  and then on campus here part of my sorority sigma kappa  the tech fair which is involved in bringing a lot of companies and students here to showcase their things  i think so  i think umm  i have a little different view of what a leader is  i think theres definitely one aspect thats very obvious  that you know  you bring everyone to do what you think is best  but i think the most important part of being a leader is incorporate everyone elses ideas  i think a lot of times some people who are really strong are like natural leaders  but they dont always take the time to make sure everyone else likes what theyre doing and theyre very straight forward  and they go for it  but i think what makes a really important leader is being able to incorporate everyone elses ideas and find that middle ground that everyone wants to do  definitely  umm i know in high school as a senior last year they gave us a lot of group projects to kind of bring us out of the stereotypical classroom and get ready for uh  a new environment in college and i remember one of our projects it was my group and we were doing something for our econ class  and it was  we had to like model a situation and do the graphs  and econs like very straight forward graph wise  there isnt that much to deal with  but my group had like different ideas of how they thought the lines would shift and i remember everyone was just kind of in a panic  we had to double graph four different scenarios  and no one knew what they wanted to do  and we just had to take them two at a time and i like looked at all of the graphs  and there was some things that were similar  just everyone had a different way of going about it  so i like kind of tried to combine all the ideas and we ended up coming up with a graph that was almost a combination of everyones  so  it worked out in the end  i think what id change about myself is that i  ive always grown up a very private person  at home  it was just i always felt like my problems and my issues werent as important as what other people were dealing with so i tend to deal with them myself  which as you grow older and the problems are just so silly  like a little middle school problem may become a lot more weighty when you have so many of them  and so because of that its  sometimes i get bogged down in myself  and i never let it affect my work because i dont want anyone else to be burdened by it  but after a while it gets very overwhelming  and so i wish that id just be more willing to share that with people  i think i should get this job because i think theres so many opportunities at this company that id really like to be a part of  theres just a lot of chance for growth and a lot of chance also to do something that you love and also make a difference because of it  i think that the way i deal with problems and working together but also trying to find the best solution and bring people to that level is something that could really benefit the company as well ,5.21057444313,1,im good im freshman mit im study course computer science math high school lot community work service president united way board profit lot school club math team classic goal captain lot campus part sorority sigma kappa tech fair involve bring lot company student showcase thing think think little different view leader think theres definitely one aspect thats obvious know bring everyone think best think important part leader incorporate everyone elses idea think lot time people really strong like natural leader dont always take time make sure everyone else like theyre theyre straight forward go think make really important leader able incorporate everyone elses idea find middle ground everyone want definitely know high school senior last year give u lot group project kind bring u stereotypical classroom get ready uh new environment college remember one project group something econ class like model situation graph econs like straight forward graph wise isnt much deal group like different idea think line would shift remember everyone kind panic double graph four different scenario one know want take two time like look graphs thing similar everyone different way go like kind tried combine idea end come graph almost combination everyones work end think id change ive always grow private person home always felt like problem issue werent important people deal tend deal grow old problem silly like little middle school problem may become lot weighty many sometimes get bogged never let affect work dont want anyone else burden get overwhelming wish id willing share people think get job think there many opportunity company id really like part there lot chance growth lot chance also something love also make difference think way deal problem work together also try find best solution bring people level something could really benefit company well
pp74,hi  im good  how are you umm  well  i have been going to mit for four years now  going to graduate this year  umm  i do computer science and i really enjoy it i really like to play music ive been involved in several music groups ac  across campus i play flute  specifically umm  and i grew up on a farm in south dakota its a great place okay id say that im a leader  because  often first  first of all  in my friend group  and  and any group of people  i generally take the lead  and for example  where we are going to eat  umm and  i work in a lab  currently  and i need to direct the project  umm  for writing a  a website to collect music samples from people in toronto umm  and  im primarily directing this project and i work with some grad students  and  i make the plans for how its going to work okay umm  recently i was working  umm  just this last week actually  in a group for my computational biology class and  we had some struggles dividing the work it was  it was kind of a difficult thing to  especially since some of us were from a biological background and some of us were from a computational background umm  we had a hard time deciding the project so that it was equal work for everyone so  it was kind of difficult to resolve that  but what we ended up doing was changing our project umm  so  i tried to come up with some ways to make sure that everybody had enough  umm  enough work to do based on their backgrounds umm  i think that  i would like to make myself more comfortable  umm  meeting  new people i think that  that would enrich my life i think that  i have great background and great experience specifically in the field that  that this job would be for and  i really enjoy learning new things  and i think that im be good at it and  so  in web programming specifically theres always new technologies coming up and so  id be really excited learning how to use those ,4.80294999406,1,hi im good well go mit four year go graduate year computer science really enjoy really like play music ive involved several music group ac across campus play flute specifically grow farm south dakota great place okay id say im leader often first first friend group group people generally take lead example go eat work lab currently need direct project write website collect music sample people toronto im primarily direct project work grad student make plan go work okay recently work last week actually group computational biology class struggle divide work kind difficult thing especially since u biological background u computational background hard time decide project equal work everyone kind difficult resolve end change project try come way make sure everybody enough enough work base background think would like make comfortable meet new people think would enrich life think great background great experience specifically field job would really enjoy learn new thing think im good web program specifically there always new technology come id really excited learning use
pp76,im doing well  thanks and yourself well  im zaynab i am a junior in chemical majored in chemical engineering at mit  but im doing a minor in energy studies and a fo a concentration in anthropology i think that i am a leader this is because ive held various leadership positions at college thus far  and i think with my leadership  the groups and the organizations that ive been part of have been able to succeed for instance  at the moment  im the vice president of the african students association and the mit african students association as well  a group of 80 students  both international and domestic students so  were more of a social group  where we throw social events  such as like  cultural shows and study breaks  and things like that  just to get the african students ignited and just united so that they can confront each with whatever problems they have so i guess the most recent event that we had was a cultural show  where we displayed to the entire mit community just about what its like to be african like  through we did it through performances such as like dancing  singing  spoken word and things like that and also  other schools from the bostoncambridge area like harvard  boston university  wellesley  and so on  they also came  attendance and that was fun i think the time  like  when there was a conflict in my team was  when i was doing this project for one of my classes  which was in my sophomore year so  there was  like  a group of four of us and we all divided the topic evenly so that we could all focus on a specific part of the project  however  there was one person that just wasnt pulling her weight so  i wasnt too sure whether it was just shes stressed or busy with other things  like towards the end of the semester where she just didnt put the effort into doing what she was meant to do so i did confront her about it  and she told me that she hadnt had time to do the necessary work so i just said  just block out some time in your schedule  and lets meet up and lets do the work together  and we were able to produce  um  i guess a very good product at the end of the day the option to change one thing i think i would be more outgoing in the terms of speaking  being able to speak to others more freely and confidently  because at the moment  i do speak with people i dont know and do work with people that arent my friends or arent in my social circle  but i wish i was more outgoing in the sense of i was more comfortable speaking with other people and interacting with other people  things like that i think i should get the job because i have a very strong academic background i have experiences in different companies thus far in my very short academic career  and i think ive been able to work with a variety of people i would be an asset to any team im a part of ,5.29114024864,1,im well thanks well im zaynab junior chemical major chemical engineering mit im minor energy study fo concentration anthropology think leader ive hold various leadership position college thus far think leadership group organization ive part able succeed instance moment im vice president african student association mit african student association well group student international domestic student social group throw social event like cultural show study breaks thing like get african student ignite united confront whatever problem guess recent event cultural show display entire mit community like african like performance like dance sing spoken word thing like also school bostoncambridge area like harvard boston university wellesley also come attendance fun think time like conflict team project one class sophomore year like group four u divide topic evenly could focus specific part project however one person wasnt pull weight wasnt sure whether shes stress busy thing like towards end semester didnt put effort meant confront tell hadnt time necessary work say block time schedule let meet let work together able produce um guess good product end day option change one thing think would outgo term speak able speak others freely confidently moment speak people dont know work people arent friend arent social circle wish outgo sense comfortable speak people interact people thing like think get job strong academic background experience different company thus far short academic career think ive able work variety people would asset team im part
pp77,im doing well  how are you so  my background is in mechanical engineering  um  whats  um and product management  so product development uh  basically  what im looking to do now is  uh  find a role that combines product management and  uh  communications skills to be with a technical background as well yes  um  so  i think leadership doesnt have to be something that always  uh   done in a formal role i think leadership is something that you do actively in every part of your life  uh  whether its taking initiative turning on a light in a dark classroom when no body wants to stand up  something small like that to actually having a formal leadership role  with uh  leading a group and team members so  i try to always  uh  stay on top of those things so  take initiative if im in a group  scheduling a meeting  whether i have a formal role  um  and be on top of things and  uh  be proactive definitely uh  so  right now  im working on a  i just actually finished a group project that we were doing and  we had to design this  uh  speech system and  we got to a point within our system where we surveyed a large number of people  it was like 630 people that we surveyed  and we realized that what they wanted was not what wed designed our system for  one thing about myself thats a tough one i have a tendency sometimes to take on a lot all at once and not i will sometimes get bogged down in all the little details of prioritizing all the small fun things that i have to do and not always taking a step back and focusing on  um  the small picture but  im trying to change that in the way i focus on manage my time  um  really noticing what is it that im dedicating my time to  and how can it be better utilized or  what is it that is actually should be a priority um  and how do i reorganize things so  i try to do that  um  at least weekly  just look back  you know  what did i do this week  what did i get done  where was i loosing time  what was happening um  to try to make  try to  uh  fix that tendency in myself and  um  hope that becomes habit i think i have a lot of qualifications that  um  fit exactly what this job is asking for uh  both the skills to communicate and to manage people and technical background so i understand whats going on uh  but  beyond that  i really  i love the company i love whats happening at the company  im inspired by the work here and for me  its really important that i not only enjoy the work im doing  but also the people im doing it with and so far  everyone that ive met  ive loved them and its been a really great experience ,5.19867504461,1,im well background mechanical engineering um whats um product management product development uh basically im look uh find role combine product management uh communication skill technical background well yes um think leadership doesnt something always uh do formal role think leadership something actively every part life uh whether take initiative turn light dark classroom body want stand something small like actually formal leadership role uh lead group team member try always uh stay top thing take initiative im group schedule meet whether formal role um top thing uh proactive definitely uh right im work actually finish group project design uh speech system get point within system survey large number people like people survey realize want wed design system one thing thats tough one tendency sometimes take lot sometimes get bogged little detail prioritize small fun thing always take step back focus um small picture im try change way focus manage time um really notice im dedicating time well utilized actually priority um reorganize thing try um least weekly look back know week get do loosing time happen um try make try uh fix tendency um hope become habit think lot qualification um fit exactly job ask uh skill communicate manage people technical background understand whats go uh beyond really love company love whats happen company im inspire work really important enjoy work im also people im far everyone ive meet ive love really great experience
pp78,im doing well  how are you im uh a junior in computer science  i used to be a chemistry major  so last summer i worked in a chemistry lab synthesizing pharmaceuticals  but now im taking more computer science classes and im interested in software  yeah i would say that im a leader  i have a lot of leadership positions  again the president of my a capella group and im the room assignment chair in my dorm  so i have to manage people like for the room assignment chair theres an event where i have to make sure that all of the freshman come down to the dining hall at a certain time and then get them to be lead around to the different parts of the dorm and then they get to decide where they live  yeah so eh i would consider myself a team player  in my a capella group often times there are different disagreements about how we want to sing a certain song like whether a certain part should be loud or quiet and we have to discuss it instead of just arguing over the details  so weve gotten better at figuring out how to settle disputes mmmmmm  thats a difficult question i would probably try to make myself less self conscious because its uh it sometimes being self conscious gets in the way because it makes me think twice about doing something and then i hesitate too much and dont do something that i should do because im enthusiastic and im good at problem solving and i like facebook a lot laughs ,5.11916912049,1,im well im uh junior computer science use chemistry major last summer work chemistry lab synthesize pharmaceutical im take computer science class im interested software yeah would say im leader lot leadership position president capella group im room assignment chair dorm manage people like room assignment chair theres event make sure freshman come din hall certain time get lead around different part dorm get decide live yeah eh would consider team player capella group often time different disagreement want sing certain song like whether certain part loud quiet discus instead argue detail weve get well figure settle dispute mmmmmm thats difficult question would probably try make less self conscious uh sometimes self conscious get way make think twice something hesitate much dont something im enthusiastic im good problem solve like facebook lot laugh
pp79,um  good  related to self or career or ok  um  so my name jessica aria and i come from  uh  india i come from it thinking and i do computers i then did chemical engineering in europe and indonesia which i found amazing so  i was like  maybe this is what i want to do so  i shifted over to computer science  um  and im a junior right now its been going great im generally interested in  um  in energy education  recently  robotics um and  uh   what i  um  i hope to do  im not particulary clear about what i want to do after that hopefully  eventually  something enterprenurial and definitely including something i experience with before that depending on how that goes i may not stick with academics after that um  ive always been super excited about that and doing projects that actually make a difference to  you know  people thats kind of what i want to do but how i want to do it  um  is not yet been foregone     um  i do  um well  there is all that said  sorts definitions of leadership i do believe  um  that i have had the good fortune of being a leader  um  in numerous student clubs  and in high school  and even at mit um  even in the presence of graduate students um  ive managed to sort of  um obivously  they know more academically  but  um  ive still managed to like hold my ground oh  and because i think im involved in a lot of stuff that goes on on campus  stuff  thats just  and um  thats what sort of made me realize that  um  i do like people i like working with people  and i like generally working on a team i do believe im good enough to sort of lead and at the same time technical enough to sort of understand what it is that we want to achieve and convince everyone  and have this mutual consensus that this is how we should do it um  so yeah definitely  i feel like  i like working with teams  i like people i work with um  and example related to a class i took i dont remember the name of it exactly  but it was something related to mobile development we had to make an app as part of the class and one of our ideas was that if you have the iphones and you could kind of bump the two of them together it was kind of a novel idea in relation to what everyone else was doing in terms of photo sharing and meeeting friends i was required with the technical expertise there was this new thing that was developed at mits regional lab called swipe which i had basically allowed you to swipe from one phone to another for data sharing it was to get data across it wasnt really what we wanted  but we thought it was a good start a couple of members on my team knew the people that started it and one girl on my team was particular gung ho about it  um  the four the us one guy was experienced and super excited to be trying new stuff another experienced programmer was relatively alright with this  and then there was me who was sort of relatively alright um  and there was someone else who was a freshman at the time and she was basically ok with every idea that we said  intervieweee so  um  and he really wanted to use it but  after a few tries he realized it wasnt working and  we went back to the people who made sky uh  swipe  and they said maybe its not read for production yet  and maybe you should stop using while the other member of my team still wanted to keep using it um  we had to sit back  but we had to still complete the project  so um we had to deal with somehow understanding where he comes from  and we had to sort of do something about it we had a meeting that resolved it  um  and we had to sort of say  this is why we think swipe is cool  but this is also why we think we should not use it we had to complain that  um  that link is like swipe  but it would not do what we needed it to over a series of meetings  he came to realize that um  it evolved  that you know  um  we had to stick to the group and we would say something like  maybe you could do this link real quick for me  and he had to realize  like  maybe i can laughter so  he was like  it was a very short time to get him to sort of fix it  so  we would not use swipe but thought of something that thought pushes and you know i  so  well  i would actually change  even though this is in the past i would  have a deeper understanding understanding of math that sounds really strange i know but  what i consider myself intuitive in general  i understand the concept i would want to know  what to do  in that situation but  in other situations  i realize  this is a really into academics i realize that having a superior understanding of mathematics is so key  um  i really believe i have a good understanding i just really wish i had done more of that  um you know  when i was littler i wish i had just like known what i wanted to do when i was really little so i could have actually started working on it but  that being said  thats not something thats not something  thats something im already working towards shifting ive already gotten a lot better at  you know understanding  you know  the theory behind the math um  and definitely by the time  you know  i graduate  um  ready for this to will have changed you know  some people have been doing it since  they were  you know  five  and i kind of been doing it this is not what i understand right now  but last year i sort of could im in my last semester  as in three classes away from completing my computer science degree so  that makes me feel like i can do that i wish i had done it a lot earlier um  well  its because  first its about  first its because im super excited about working in this industry  and definitely in this company working with great people um  i think there is a lot to be learned from that and  those two factors really is  basically  uh  why i want it and  as to why i should get it  and its because i can learn really quickly and um i believe that im a team player  and um  and try to really fix things and  i would like to quote one of my professors who said either youre building the product  or selling it  or getting in the way so  i definitely feel that  um  i could be  um  building the product really well  um  and to contribute in general positively  with your message  ,4.47341162906,0,um good relate self career ok um name jessica aria come uh india come think computer chemical engineering europe indonesia find amaze like maybe want shift computer science um im junior right go great im generally interested um energy education recently robotics um uh um hope im particulary clear want hopefully eventually something enterprenurial definitely include something experience depend go may stick academic um ive always super excited project actually make difference know people thats kind want want um yet foregone um um well say sort definition leadership believe um good fortune leader um numerous student club high school even mit um even presence graduate student um ive manage sort um obivously know academically um ive still manage like hold ground oh think im involve lot stuff go campus stuff thats um thats sort make realize um like people like work people like generally work team believe im good enough sort lead time technical enough sort understand want achieve convince everyone mutual consensus um yeah definitely feel like like work team like people work um example related class take dont remember name exactly something related mobile development make app part class one idea iphones could kind bump two together kind novel idea relation everyone else term photo share meeeting friend require technical expertise new thing develop mit regional lab call swipe basically allow swipe one phone another data sharing get data across wasnt really want think good start couple member team knew people start one girl team particular gung ho um four u one guy experience super excite try new stuff another experience programmer relatively alright sort relatively alright um someone else freshman time basically ok every idea say intervieweee um really want use try realize wasnt work go back people make sky uh swipe say maybe read production yet maybe stop use member team still want keep use um sit back still complete project um deal somehow understanding come sort something meeting resolve um sort say think swipe cool also think use complain um link like swipe would need series meeting come realize um evolve know um stick group would say something like maybe could link real quick realize like maybe laughter like short time get sort fix would use swipe thought something thought push know well would actually change even though past would deeper understand understanding math sound really strange know consider intuitive general understand concept would want know situation situation realize really academic realize superior understanding mathematics key um really believe good understanding really wish do um know littler wish like know want really little could actually start work say thats something thats something thats something im already work towards shift ive already get lot good know understand know theory behind math um definitely time know graduate um ready change know people since know five kind understand right last year sort could im last semester three class away complete computer science degree make feel like wish do lot earlier um well first first im super excite work industry definitely company work great people um think lot learn two factor really basically uh want get learn really quickly um believe im team player um try really fix thing would like quote one professor say either youre build product sell get way definitely feel um could um build product really well um contribute general positively message
pp8, so i am a junior at mit  ah  i am in computer science and i have taken several classes in algorithms and in xxnessus six   and i am also doing studying on my own machine and i plan on taking that next semester before summer starts umm to develop data analysis and machine running skills  especially in field of pattern recognition which i am very interest in and uh i hope that will give me some training for internship that i will do in that field ah that will give me more practice in the real world  i think i am  i think i am a leader ah i have lead several projects in the past ah as in my position as that community service chair and um  and one in my ah fraternity pledge class and the other in my ah in the student group that i am part of the south asian american student corp and successfully completed um  service  projects with the community as well as organizing ah events for ah raising money for charity   ah and also for school projects i frequently ah i am good at assigning tasks keeping people on task and um as well as gathering input from everybody um which i think are the essential quality of a good leader    i do consider myself a team player ah going back to the example of my pledge class from my fraternity uh we had several tasks one of which would be to visit every other every student in the pledge class storm week  this was during freshman year   and with a pledge class has  13 people it is not a impossible task but there were logistical problem one communication trying to get everybody to participate another is  figuring  out the best way to go about things people wanting to  meet in the middle ect so i did my part as a team member to lead people to my room and show up myself um but a good team player should also make sure that other people are doing their job ah not necessarily in a lead or a managerial role but with the same general properties as a leader ah that all the team members should be checking one another and so i ah pardon that to um when there was several members missing i would ah say hey you call this person and i will call this person split up tasks etc ah and also help in planning  with whats  the best route to go by etc  if i had to change one thing about myself naturally there are a lot of thing i wish i could  change about myself i wish i could do better at basketball  but ah i think if i had to pick one quality it would probably be my ah  abillity to stay focused on a task  although i am pretty efficient at ah getting things done and i do create ideas sometimes i get distracted or i like to multitask so i might be staying on task with work in general but ill like to  have three different homework sessions going on at once and find this one and this a lot of times that will work really well  for me but if i working collaboratively that may not work best for other people so making myself more adaptive to other peoples study styles working styles etc  that would probably help me a lot   i think i should get this job because ah for two main reasons one because i would provide a lot the company because i am very efficient at working i can think creatively for new ideas say for new ways to analyse certain new data or to optimize the running of the ah of certain ah software ah on the other hand the other reason i should get this job is because i would be a valuable member of valuable member of the workplace in this field i think by getting more experience um with this start up i think i would ah really would  help me with my study skills that would help me in the future  ,4.98336118463,1,junior mit ah computer science take several class algorithms xxnessus six also study machine plan take next semester summer start develop data analysis machine run skill especially field pattern recognition interest uh hope give train internship field ah give practice real world think think leader ah lead several project past ah position community service chair um one ah fraternity pledge class ah student group part south asian american student corp successfully complete um service project community well organize ah event ah raise money charity ah also school project frequently ah good assigning task keep people task um well gather input everybody um think essential quality good leader consider team player ah go back example pledge class fraternity uh several task one would visit every every student pledge class storm week freshman year pledge class people impossible task logistical problem one communication try get everybody participate another figuring best way go thing people want meet middle ect part team member lead people room show um good team player also make sure people job ah necessarily lead managerial role general property leader ah team member check one another ah pardon um several member miss would ah say hey call person call person split task etc ah also help plan whats best route go etc change one thing naturally lot thing wish could change wish could better basketball ah think pick one quality would probably ah abillity stay focus task although pretty efficient ah get thing do create idea sometimes get distract like multitask might stay task work general ill like three different homework session go find one lot time work really well work collaboratively may work best people make adaptive people study style work style etc would probably help lot think get job ah two main reason one would provide lot company efficient work think creatively new idea say new way analyse certain new data optimize run ah certain ah software ah hand reason get job would valuable member valuable member workplace field think get experience um start think would ah really would help study skill would help future
pp80,mmhmm fine  thank you how about yourself so  im from berkley  california  and i came to mit to study bioengineering and its been a really great education because ive learned to combine like engineering skills  real world skills with all this academic knowledge  um  and especially true in my lab where the combination between handson research and like thinking about how the research is working has really come together to improve my understanding of science and medicine i think i have great leadership potential uh  i am currently head of the greek medlinks at mit and what medlinks is  is this really great program where we serve as the liaison between students and healthcare facilities mit has so much support  so much support and there isi mean we havethe students have great access to it but a lot of times we dont know to look for it right it can be right in front of your face  and if youre not looking  its not there so we do a lot of outreach stuff  so sure so  i think team work isthe only way to get anything doneright  an individual  what are you going to do um  so  i played on the golf team in high school and were a closeknit team but golf is a mental game and sometimes it can get to your head if youre not playing well  and you just play worse and its a downward spiral and youre with someone out on the course for five hours and if you have like a little feud between each other  youre still going to be stuck with that person for five hours  so  im not great with administrative work  i have trouble with like little menial deadlines and all this writing and signatures and getting everything organized it stresses me out but im learning to deal with it by electronicsah the new age it is my savior well  i think i should go to medical school because i love people  and i love to help  and ive got the academic background for it im not afraid to work hard and put in long hours medicine is fascinating surrounded by all these diseases thati mean weve made such great progress  but theres just more that we can study so  im currently studying in my lab  uh  work in an hiv lab and that really inspired me to go into medicine because  you know  im looking at all these cuttingedge technologies and its like i want to be right where theyre being implemented  not just on the research side but on the people side as well ,5.17020439412,1,mmhmm fine thank im berkley california come mit study bioengineering really great education ive learn combine like engineering skill real world skill academic knowledge um especially true lab combination handson research like think research work really come together improve understand science medicine think great leadership potential uh currently head greek medlinks mit medlinks really great program serve liaison student healthcare facility mit much support much support isi mean havethe student great access lot time dont know look right right front face youre look lot outreach stuff sure think team work isthe way get anything doneright individual go um played golf team high school closeknit team golf mental game sometimes get head youre playing well play bad downward spiral youre someone course five hour like little feud youre still go stuck person five hour im great administrative work trouble like little menial deadline write signature get everything organize stress im learn deal electronicsah new age savior well think go medical school love people love help ive get academic background im afraid work hard put long hour medicine fascinate surround disease thati mean weve make great progress there study im currently study lab uh work hiv lab really inspire go medicine know im look cuttingedge technology like want right theyre implement research side people side well
pp81,um  i am a sophomore at mit um  im studying brain and cognitive science  with a minor in biology right now im working in a lab that is more of a narrow cognition lab we work  um  basically to try to figure out pathways in the brain that process different functions um  its a longitudinal study um  so its something im really interested in but i think moving forward im going to try to start working with from a pharmacology aspect  because its such an emerging field um  thats mainly where i want to go  because i hope to eventually work  um  in   and so pharmacology would be very important for that field i think i am a leader  in a sense that i see people as people  and i see tasks as tasks  and i know how to communicate effectively between how to get these tasks done and how to get the people to do them and i think im a good motivator  good communicator  and im also very detailoriented so it helps me better able to break down  um  people in order to delegate  um  more fundamentals or specific tasks  in order to get them done more effectively yes  i consider myself a team player  because i do think im very fair and always open to what other people are thinking so in  movement  which is an oncampus student group which basically seeks to provide inner city boston high school students with better access to reading and math comprehension to help better prepare them for the sat test we meet with three or four of them once a week on a sunday and large groups  so theyre  like  small groups that two members are on a charter so im part of a twoperson team  and then we all meet together so i would sometimes disagree with my partner as well as the  as a whole in terms of what we should be teaching and what we should be focusing on  whether we should look more at science  whether we should have more holistic education versus just teaching to the sat i think that basically what i was trying to do was explain my point if the group thought that what i was saying had some merit and liked to incorporate it i would feel good but if they didnt  then i would accept the fact that that was the way they felt and  you know  majority rules and i didnt have any hard feelings at the end of the day i wanted whats best for the kids so in a sense i am a team player because i want whats best for the project as a whole its not just all about me and getting my point across i definitely think it would be making myself more organized so im extremely detailoriented  and i see exactly what needs to be done and the timeline it needs to get done but i guess since im involved in so many things  being a student  as well as in a sorority  as well as pursuing various academic endeavors  i think that  um  sometimes that bogs me down knowing exactly what i need to get done and what timeline  and then i get overstretched but i think thats an easy problem to fix um  and so far as we  you know  you get more specialized over the course of our lives i definitely have a path that is more specialized that i intend to pursue so that wont be a problem  and i think just maintaining basic organizational structure definitely helps me  but it would be a lot easier if i didnt have to maintain anything and that was just naturally the way i was  so i think that i have im very interested in what your company is doing  and im very interested in what this project specifically is related to  but i also think i have a lot to offer the group as well i am a mit student whos given a very specific set of problems and some solving skills that would be very unique to the group but im also very outgoing and very interested in interpersonal relationships and i think that could help me convey our message as well as work with the technical aspect of the team ,6.28421357952,1,um sophomore mit um im study brain cognitive science minor biology right im work lab narrow cognition lab work um basically try figure pathways brain process different function um longitudinal study um something im really interested think move forward im go try start work pharmacology aspect emerge field um thats mainly want go hope eventually work um pharmacology would important field think leader sense see people people see tasks task know communicate effectively get task do get people think im good motivator good communicator im also detailoriented help well able break um people order delegate um fundamental specific task order get do effectively yes consider team player think im fair always open people think movement oncampus student group basically seek provide inner city boston high school student well access read math comprehension help well prepare sat test meet three four week sunday large group theyre like small group two member charter im part twoperson team meet together would sometimes disagree partner well whole term teach focus whether look science whether holistic education versus teach sat think basically try explain point group think say merit like incorporate would feel good didnt would accept fact way felt know majority rule didnt hard feeling end day want whats best kid sense team player want whats best project whole get point across definitely think would make organize im extremely detailoriented see exactly need do timeline need get do guess since im involve many thing student well sorority well pursue various academic endeavor think um sometimes bogs know exactly need get do timeline get overstretch think thats easy problem fix um far know get specialized course live definitely path specialize intend pursue wont problem think maintain basic organizational structure definitely help would lot easy didnt maintain anything naturally way think im interested company im interested project specifically relate also think lot offer group well mit student who give specific set problem solve skill would unique group im also outgo interested interpersonal relationship think could help convey message well work technical aspect team
pp83,um  pretty good  pretty good getting busy with studying for finals  um  alright  so  i  ive been studying at mit for three years i initially started as a physics major actually  so sophomore year i took  um  a couple physics classes in relativity  um  waves and vibrations uh  and then one of the classes that had been recommended to me was computational neuroscience  which also counts for physics department so  um  after that was intro to neuroscience so i took that  fell in love with neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience  so i started taking more classes in that um  im working on it  um  definitely uh  i mean  i do  i do like working in a team as equal group members  um  i feel like i can be a leader uh  for example  this past summer i was in china  and  uh  they let me  uh  teach a classroom of 60 students um  and so that really help to strengthen my leadership skills  just in terms of classroom management and getting everyone to work together as a group yeah um  i feel like i  i  um  so  uh  in that last summer as well in china  we had sort of a problem uh  we were trying to get some videos up on a website um  none of us had any computer science background  and so  um  i tried to find a student who had both computer science background and spoke english to a level where we could  like  actually communicate um  so  uh  i participated in that  in that kind of way hmm lets see um  id say  probably  i get kind of nervous sometimes um  id say id like to calm down a little bit uh i mean  sometimes its good  like  i i have lots of energy  but sometimes its just a bit too much laughs to be able to  um  so  i mean  im very committed  but on top of that i have a very strong academic background ive done research before in this area and  um  in a similar field  but sort of  um  also different so i think i come in with a different sort of perspective to this and also  i mean  i come in with  like  some physics background so i think that additionally provides a different perspective on brain and cognitive science that isnt always seen that sort of  like  very analytical way of thinking  and  like  seeing things at the most fundamental level  i bring that perspective in ,4.87847800231,1,um pretty good pretty good get busy study final um alright ive study mit three year initially start physic major actually sophomore year take um couple physic class relativity um wave vibration uh one class recommend computational neuroscience also count physic department um intro neuroscience take fell love neuroscience cognitive neuroscience start take class um im work um definitely uh mean like work team equal group member um feel like leader uh example past summer china uh let uh teach classroom student um really help strengthen leadership skill term classroom management get everyone work together group yeah um feel like um uh last summer well china sort problem uh try get videos website um none u computer science background um try find student computer science background speak english level could like actually communicate um uh participate kind way hmm let see um id say probably get kind nervous sometimes um id say id like calm little bit uh mean sometimes good like lot energy sometimes bit much laughs able um mean im commit top strong academic background ive do research area um similar field sort um also different think come different sort perspective also mean come like physic background think additionally provide different perspective brain cognitive science isnt always see sort like analytical way think like see thing fundamental level bring perspective
pp84, good thank you  how are you  alright  well  so im originally from australia  and um  since then my family and i have moved around a lot so i would consider myself an international citizen  im actually not an american citizen  um  but ive been here studying at mit material science for uh  three years now and im enjoying it  um  its helped me figure out that im really interested in engineering and im really loving having a bit of material science as well as mechanical engineering which is what im doing a minor it yes  definitely um  well i can tell you that i was told that at a leadership conference that i went to earlier this year um  we classified personalities in teamworking situations and i was definitely one of the more leader type one people where i work well with a team but i like have things  i like to do things well my way or i like to at least beif i want to see something done right then want to  i would like to do it right  um  then ive had a lot of chance to practice that and i would say that ive gotten pretty good at incorporating that personality type with other types of personalities in teamwork situations  so  for example im  um  copresident  ive recently been elected president of amnesty international here on campus and i  so ive had a lot of experience with that group up until now working with them  trying to lead a team  trying to help them take initiative for themselves  trying to encourage them as well as be a leader by example and do all of  as much as i can uh  handle comfortably to make the club a success  okay  um well  yeah  um  amnesty international is another good example  weve had a few tensions between personalities  um  the year before  so last year  we had two copresidents and one of them was a pretty opinionated person  someone who had strong feelings toward his vision for the club and just went for it with all like  all of his effort into that one direction and just didnt really look back and didnt look around to see how other people felt about it  which  i was okay with because i saw his direction being really beneficial for the club  um  but we had another member of the team who was not okay with that  she felt also that she had a lot to give and she felt like none of her ideas were being heard  so  they would actually get into some tense email situations and there was a bit of tension in the group  but  it actually kind of became resolved during elections this year  um  they worked together fairly well during the semester  um  especially when they werent both in the same room at the same time  just working via email it was good  and then today  uh  sorry  this week during elections it kind of all came out into the open and now that hes not president any more and shes in the same role as treasurer  um  its been resolved  um  i guess my role in that was just kind of being uh  the team player  just trying to make whatever we trying to do work successfully so that there was no added tension from our efforts being a failure   oh  interesting question  i  i would like to be a better public speaker  actually  i would really like to be able to synthesize my thoughts quickly and coherently  um  i think that would make me a better writer and i think that in general being a great at communicating is one of the strongest skills that you can have to convince people to  to just make whatever project youre working on be a success  to convince investors to invest money  to obtain partnerships and sponsorships  to be a good leader  to inspirei think  i would love to be able to just have an infinite vocabulary and have a very  you know  better way of presenting my ideas  um  i do think i am qualified for the job because ive had a lot of experience in this industry  ive worked in research in material science for the last two summers as well as ive had a lot of leadership experience  um  not just in amnesty international but also in my sorority  and um  what was the other one  i was an orientation leader for um  orientation at mit  which was a cool experience  so  um  ive had a lot different ways to develop my teamworking skills and id really like to put those to work in industrybased projects now um  which ive seen a lot of but ive never had a chance to actually try it out  so  im excited to try that ,4.89011375661,1,good thank alright well im originally australia um since family move around lot would consider international citizen im actually american citizen um ive study mit material science uh three year im enjoy um help figure im really interested engineering im really loving bit material science well mechanical engineering im minor yes definitely um well tell told leadership conference go early year um classify personality teamworking situation definitely one leader type one people work well team like thing like thing well way like least beif want see something do right want would like right um ive lot chance practice would say ive gotten pretty good incorporate personality type type personality teamwork situation example im um copresident ive recently elect president amnesty international campus ive lot experience group work try lead team try help take initiative try encourage well leader example much uh handle comfortably make club success okay um well yeah um amnesty international another good example weve tension personality um year last year two copresidents one pretty opinionated person someone strong feeling toward vision club go like effort one direction didnt really look back didnt look around see people felt okay saw direction really beneficial club um another member team okay felt also lot give felt like none idea heard would actually get tense email situation bite tension group actually kind become resolved election year um work together fairly well semester um especially werent room time work via email good today uh sorry week election kind come open he president shes role treasurer um resolve um guess role kind uh team player try make whatever try work successfully add tension effort failure oh interesting question would like good public speaker actually would really like able synthesize thought quickly coherently um think would make good writer think general great communicate one strong skill convince people make whatever project youre work success convince investor invest money obtain partnership sponsorships good leader inspirei think would love able infinite vocabulary know good way present idea um think qualified job ive lot experience industry ive work research material science last two summer well ive lot leadership experience um amnesty international also sorority um one orientation leader um orientation mit cool experience um ive lot different way develop teamworking skill id really like put work industrybased project um ive see lot ive never chance actually try im excited try
pp85,okay  well im a junior here at mit umm  im doublemajoring courses  which is uh  the  computer science and bioengineering  and i guess those are two very different things  so i get alot of questions about why  and i think its um  because i came to mit thinking i wanted to do bioengineering and then i guess i just feel like i everyone around here like  has some relation to programming sometime  and then i took a programming class  got bit by the bug  and then i just like  i loved it and then  so last year  i decided to double major  cause um  im actually interested in a lot of i guess there is an overlap  between like biocircuits as well as just modeling biological systems with computer science  so um it was a really good opportunity here  so yeah um  i do think im a leader  and then i guess thats one of the things  me coming to mit  i wouldnt have said im a leader necessarily  even though like i guess i was like  did some things in high school but um  i think thats one of the things i  really thankful from mit  its really developed my ability to be confident  as well as um  i think just to motivate other people and uh  and its like  just like  if i wanted to get something done like i think something really like i think something really cool will happen with some ideea  then what ill do is ill  like  get a couple of people together  like get them motivated by  uh  figuring out what needs to get done logistically and just like  assign people  i think a timeline and stuff like that  and  i think um  my experience at mit has  uh  like really given me that experience and as well as actually just allowing me to find these people that  cause theres a lot of really awesome people here and usually willing to do the exact same thing or you tell them about other ideas and theyre really excited about it just like you are  so so yeah  so i think  um  what like one of the things i guess obviously is you have to be able to take direction just as well as you give it  otherwise youre team cant function and  so i guess um one of the times i was on a team was um for example ah  in a fraternity and for the fall we have rush  which is basically allwe have 26 fraternities at mit  theres a 1 000 incoming freshman youre essentially like all  somehow  competing almost for them but ah i guess one of the other things youre just looking for the people that are a good fit for you  but you want to meet as many people as possible  so i think one of the things that is you have to be able to take direction from your  from our rush chair so its  sometimes he needs you just to go out on campus and try to get random freshman to the house sometimes you just need to go talk to people at the house  and then  like  just have a converstaion with them and learn more about them sometimes you just need to clean dishes from the food event cause we need to get the next event  so i think  um  just being able towilling to take direction just doing anything and not losing track of the bigger goal is  i think  what makes me a good team player lot of nice restaurants laugh  ah  thats  uh  a really interesting question um i think i would make myself  ah  maybe a little bit better  i think  just in um social sitatuions with strangers  um  sometimes i just can get a little bit  like  anxious uh for example i hate  like  bit networking events  because like i never really know how to  like  walk up to someone  like just maybe like have small talk and then just leave the conversation thats some of the things that like  i guess ive never really been too extroverted of a person  so i dont really  like  say necessarily  good at just meeting lots of new people  getting them like  making a memorable impression or something like that so i think  um  thats one of the the things ive been trying to work on i think thats whats really nice about mit is  theres a lot of people like that   theres a lot a research theres a lot of  like  lot of ahh  session for people  like theres a bunch of opportunities for networking for people who hate networking and then i think a lot of people have the same or similar just like  philosphy about it  um so i think just need to change to be better about that  and just be better at talking to strangers and less apprehensive about approaching people and just starting up a conversation  ok  so i guess um  right now im looking for some software internships for the summer  and i think why i should have that job is just because i think ive gotten the technical background from like  algorithms classes  like software engineering classes but then ive also had  um  the experiences of working as a team at mit  like  uh  im on student government  um  with my fraternity  as well  as uh  i guess im pretty independent i think mit really develops everybody  you choose your own classes  like your own activities and i think im very selfsufficient so i thnk uh  for like  maybe like super ive like  mabye supervised peers in previous internships  and i think i would just be able to like  take a project im not afraid to ask a question if i need direction  and i mostly  like i can just work alone so i think its be very helpful for  i guess  just like a supervisor cause then they dont have to check up on me all the time and uh  but then uh the would also know that i would go to them when needed uh  also  im very thourough  so i would  like i dont like leaving things  like if theres a small  mistake ill like  even if it takes a long time  ill make sure that i can iron it out  so i think for  codewise  thats really nice for testing in that its often more bugfree so thank you ,4.91822728058,1,okay well im junior mit im doublemajoring course uh computer science bioengineering guess two different thing get alot question think um come mit thinking want bioengineering guess feel like everyone around like relation programming sometime take program class get bit bug like love last year decide double major cause um im actually interested lot guess overlap like biocircuits well model biological system computer science um really good opportunity yeah um think im leader guess thats one thing come mit wouldnt say im leader necessarily even though like guess like thing high school um think thats one thing really thankful mit really developed ability confident well um think motivate people uh like like wanted get something do like think something really like think something really cool happen ideea ill ill like get couple people together like get motivate uh figure need get do logistically like assign people think timeline stuff like think um experience mit uh like really give experience well actually allow find people cause there lot really awesome people usually willing exact thing tell idea theyre really excite like yeah think um like one thing guess obviously able take direction well give otherwise youre team cant function guess um one time team um example ah fraternity fall rush basically allwe fraternity mit there incoming freshman youre essentially like somehow compete almost ah guess one thing youre look people good fit want meet many people possible think one thing able take direction rush chair sometimes need go campus try get random freshman house sometimes need go talk people house like converstaion learn sometimes need clean dish food event cause need get next event think um able towilling take direction anything lose track big goal think make good team player lot nice restaurant laugh ah thats uh really interesting question um think would make ah maybe little bit well think um social sitatuions stranger um sometimes get little bit like anxious uh example hate like bit networking event like never really know like walk someone like maybe like small talk leave conversation thats thing like guess ive never really extroverted person dont really like say necessarily good meeting lot new people get like make memorable impression something like think um thats one thing ive try work think thats whats really nice mit there lot people like there lot research there lot like lot ahh session people like there bunch opportunity network people hate networking think lot people similar like philosphy um think need change well well talk stranger less apprehensive approach people start conversation ok guess um right im look software internship summer think job think ive gotten technical background like algorithms class like software engineering class ive also um experience work team mit like uh im student government um fraternity well uh guess im pretty independent think mit really develop everybody choose class like activity think im selfsufficient thnk uh like maybe like super ive like mabye supervise peer previous internship think would able like take project im afraid ask question need direction mostly like work alone think helpful guess like supervisor cause dont check time uh uh would also know would go needed uh also im thourough would like dont like leave thing like there small mistake ill like even take long time ill make sure iron think codewise thats really nice test often bugfree thank
pp86,in my technical background  um been a junior at mit um  i studied a lot of music  but ive been mainly studying robotics  mechanical engineering and a little bit of electrical uh  at mit here so  uh  ive done a few robot competitions  built a few  and um  you know  thats basically what i do  build robots and play music i think i am a leader um  because um  im very calm and i dont over react and im very good at  i wouldnt  handling is the wrong word but i guess  you know  dealing with people and making sure that they can relate with other people making a team work that type of stuff um  i like to think im pretty sociable um  im a nice guy and im easy to talk to and i think those are all very nice traits for a leader so  i would say yes  im a good leader and based on previous leadership experience i say that i did a pretty good job  so um  i  id definitely say im a good team player now  are you asking about how i worked well with the team  or how well i worked bringing the team together or how well i worked  okay  well uh  ill address all of them um  i guess  as a team member  i very quickly learned what my role was and asked you know  if theres anything i can do  what do i need to do and i do that  fill that role um  but im also very good at you know  kind of combining all of the roles together so  say  lets just  you know  on a robot  for example  theres mechanical  theres electrical  theres  theres code work that also needs to be put together and  everyone can do a great job by themselves but if theyre not working together then you know  like if i dont know what the guy  the code guy is working on and what energy equations he needs and that type of stuff then i  as an electronic guy or as a mechanical guy like  its not gonna work um  and thats how i guess i work well within a team is kind of bringing people together um  but  if there are any like  challenges i guess i faced as a team um  i guess  that really wasnt the question though was it could you repeat the question again  im sorry okay  um  okay  so a recent project i worked on with friends um  there were these two guys love them to death  theyre great guys  very talented  tyler and dan theyre very close theyve been very close for  i guess freshmen year um  they have one of those relationships where good  you know  good high points  but theres also like  they fight a lot so  um  there were a couple moments where they were just pissed at each other they hated each other they couldnt work well together so  what i did was i kind of you know  told them take  take a step back tyler  were gonna go to the student center were gonna grab some food  chillax and then were gonna get back and while we were walking to the student center i talked to him about it and talked to what his issues were and then  on the way back  he was much more calm and things progressed a lot smoother and much faster i would say one thing  okay um  i would say  time management definitely time management um  its been rough my whole life um id say its definitely been getting better but ive definitely had problems with  im very much living in the now and so sometimes i forget to think ahead and  um  there have been many instances where ive got into trouble i have a lot of work to do and its you know coming up in like  a few days and sometimes  i  i should work harder earlier on  but i dont get  you know  i dont get  im like  well i could work on it  but ive done enough tonight why dont i  i can figure it out tomorrow and usually end up working really hard um  right at the end which i guess a lot of people end up doing but  if that was one thing i could change  id say definitely better time management  being able to spread it out more evenly and be more prepared okay yeah okay um  should i go with  just go with  let my imagination flow all right okay  so were at a robotics interview um  well  i think i deserve this job  a lot because ive been working very hard i know a ton of control background i know a ton about robotics  mechanical engineering um  ive had a ton of um  handson work with robots um  and i know all the work that goes into it um  so as far as background and experience that ive had with robotics  id say im very well um  informed  i wouldnt say informed i  experienced  i dont want to use the word experienced again but thats  i have a lot of experience in robotics um  and ive  since ive been working with it for such a long time  i can learn more about it quicker and im very  im very fast to learn so  throw me in a new situation ill  you know  oh  okay  i know what that is i can relate to that and i just work from there um  and i think im a very  i work well with people so robotics is one of those things where you have to work with a bunch of  a group of people for a common goal and id like to think that im very good at working with people so  um  and it  it sounds like a fun place to work i  ive talked to you know  some friends and some other people working there and its just  id really love to work there and i think im a good fit ,4.24030162943,0,technical background um junior mit um study lot music ive mainly study robotics mechanical engineering little bit electrical uh mit uh ive do robot competition build um know thats basically build robot play music think leader um um im calm dont react im good wouldnt handle wrong word guess know deal people make sure relate people make team work type stuff um like think im pretty sociable um im nice guy im easy talk think nice trait leader would say yes im good leader base previous leadership experience say pretty good job um id definitely say im good team player ask work well team well work bring team together well work okay well uh ill address um guess team member quickly learn role ask know there anything need fill role um im also good know kind combine role together say let know robot example there mechanical there electrical there theres code work also need put together everyone great job theyre work together know like dont know guy code guy work energy equation need type stuff electronic guy mechanical guy like gon na work um thats guess work well within team kind bring people together um like challenge guess face team um guess really wasnt question though could repeat question im sorry okay um okay recent project work friend um two guy love death theyre great guy talented tyler dan theyre close theyve close guess freshman year um one relationship good know good high point there also like fight lot um couple moment piss hated couldnt work well together kind know tell take take step back tyler gon na go student center gon na grab food chillax gon na get back walk student center talk talked issue way back much calm thing progress lot smoother much fast would say one thing okay um would say time management definitely time management um rough whole life um id say definitely get well ive definitely problem im much live sometimes forget think ahead um many instance ive get trouble lot work know come like day sometimes work hard earlier dont get know dont get im like well could work ive do enough tonight dont figure tomorrow usually end work really hard um right end guess lot people end one thing could change id say definitely good time management able spread evenly prepare okay yeah okay um go go let imagination flow right okay robotics interview um well think deserve job lot ive work hard know ton control background know ton robotics mechanical engineering um ive ton um handson work robot um know work go um far background experience ive robotics id say im well um inform wouldnt say inform experienced dont want use word experience thats lot experience robotics um ive since ive work long time learn quicker im im fast learn throw new situation ill know oh okay know relate work um think im work well people robotics one thing work bunch group people common goal id like think im good work people um sound like fun place work ive talk know friend people work id really love work think im good fit
pp89,mhmm uh so is it all right if i kind of talk about the same stuff as last time i was going to say  i havent changed too much but um yeah so still a junior at mit here  and um about halfway through junior year and um im a physics major and um im from pensacola  florida and um im  yeah so born and raised in pensacola and i just um uh you know moved up here a couple years ago and started at mit and i uh  im not sure as far as what im going to go into career wise but im looking at something applied in the physics area and um as far as extracurricular go i do a few things im involved with a few im sports that my fraternity does uh  soccer and basketball  and i enjoy juggling and unicycling as well ive done  ive unicylced since 5th grade and ive done that a lot and um im involved with the juggling club here and i like to play ultimate frisbee as well from time to time just for fun and um yeah so you know enjoy doing sports in my spare time but uh yeah physics as far as school goes do i think im sorry a leader oh um yeah in some senses  i like  as far as leadership experience ive had  ive enjoyed more in the small group type things like ive mentioned before in high school i led a small group of students to do a community service project where we organized a math competition and um i uh i enjoy doing  um for one of my internships  i worked at a robotics firm and it was a pretty small group  it was 4 or 5 of us but i go to kind of have some leadership on some of the tasks there that was fun and uh yeah i mean juggling club is a little bit of a leadership position  theres a few people i kind of oversee there and you know those few leadership experiences ive had have been really good um you know i guess besides those three  i havent had any larger scale leadership experiences with you know more people but those i have enjoyed i guess i consider myself a leader in that regard yeah um so i mean this past semester ive done some team stuff just one on one with a partner for my um lab class and um so i got to kind of do some team playing there but um i guess another time was uh last january i was in mexico as well but this time it was with an exchange program and it was the whole month and next week ill actually going back for fun for a week but yeah it was  mexico and it was me and two other students at a high school and we basically got there and we thought they were going to know what were supposed to do  it was the first time they had done the program and we get there and they were like  okay well what are you guys going to do and we were like  well we were going to ask you the same thing so we kind of had to come together with the three of us and figure out what to do so we uh we talked at first and well kind of had familiarity with a lot of different subjects as far as like  especially applications of what these students were learning  calculus and physics and how to demonstrate those we decided to each give little lectures on topics that were relevant to what the students were learning they might you know be going to a certain field to apply later on like especially calculus but also the physics classes and stuff i ended up doing two main things  i gave a few physics demonstrations uh and you know they had some equipment there  i just talked about vectors and how to halve those and force equations and then you know we had a couple weights and walked through the class how to predict how it would work out and actually measured it and so that was cool all three of the students collaborated on what we should talk about because we kind of were familiar with what everybody else was talking about it turned out pretty well  we ended up helping them out and getting their students to have some faith and how these things of learning are applied yeah so i guess major time where a big obstacle is overcome um lets see  well the first thing that popped in my mind was that uh if i was a little shorter i could be an astronaut but i think the height requirement is changed for that im 63 and i think a few years ago it was 61 which is the cut off okay yeah that too um i guess um lets see  my um  uh i guess as far as larger scale positions go  like kind of being decisive i think this is like a common problem for you know undergraduates here because you know you come in and i guess a major way american schools are different from schools in other countries we have all the options open and so um you know its a tough thing to you know have all these options and be decisive with one thing and be able to like you know if youre in an environment where youre more restricted and you just put yourself in that as far as larger scales go and smaller scales too with whether its  i dont know just managing things just day to day i feel like time managements you know a major part of that being decisive stuff yeah i think decision making would be the main thing yep um well im standing by one of the things i mentioned before which is mainly that i think i communicate pretty well as far as small groups  ive had a good amount of experience working with people on  you know  in real time problem solving ive had experience there and i think thats a major attribute that i can bring to the board and bring to the table and um as far as experience goes  yeah i mean things i mentioned before just coming back as far as like diversity of background and being able to bring multiple perspectives i have kind of experience with physics and more like applied things like robotics so i think that diversity of things really helps and um yeah yeah thank you ,4.2585253044,0,mhmm uh right kind talk stuff last time go say havent change much um yeah still junior mit um halfway junior year um im physic major um im pensacola florida um im yeah bear raise pensacola um uh know move couple year ago start mit uh im sure far im go go career wise im look something applied physic area um far extracurricular go thing im involved im sport fraternity uh soccer basketball enjoy juggle unicycle well ive do ive unicylced since th grade ive do lot um im involve juggle club like play ultimate frisbee well time time fun um yeah know enjoy sport spare time uh yeah physic far school go think im sorry leader oh um yeah sens like far leadership experience ive ive enjoy small group type thing like ive mention high school lead small group student community service project organize math competition um uh enjoy um one internship work robotics firm pretty small group u go kind leadership task fun uh yeah mean juggle club little bit leadership position theres people kind oversee know leadership experience ive really good um know guess besides three havent large scale leadership experience know people enjoyed guess consider leader regard yeah um mean past semester ive do team stuff one one partner um lab class um get kind team playing um guess another time uh last january mexico well time exchange program whole month next week ill actually go back fun week yeah mexico two student high school basically get think go know suppose first time do program get like okay well guy go like well go ask thing kind come together three u figure uh talk first well kind familiarity lot different subject far like especially application student learn calculus physic demonstrate decide give little lecture topic relevant student learn might know go certain field apply later like especially calculus also physics class stuff end two main thing give physic demonstration uh know equipment talk vector halve force equation know couple weight walk class predict would work actually measure cool three student collaborate talk kind familiar everybody else talk turn pretty well end help get student faith thing learn applied yeah guess major time big obstacle overcome um let see well first thing pop mind uh little shorter could astronaut think height requirement change im think year ago cut okay yeah um guess um let see um uh guess far large scale position go like kind decisive think like common problem know undergraduate know come guess major way american school different school country option open um know tough thing know option decisive one thing able like know youre environment youre restrict put far large scale go small scale whether dont know manage thing day day feel like time management know major part decisive stuff yeah think decision making would main thing yep um well im stand one thing mention mainly think communicate pretty well far small group ive good amount experience work people know real time problem solve ive experience think thats major attribute bring board bring table um far experience go yeah mean thing mention come back far like diversity background able bring multiple perspective kind experience physic like applied thing like robotics think diversity thing really help um yeah yeah thank
